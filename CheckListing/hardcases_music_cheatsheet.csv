0,"I have now seen the future of country/bluegrass music - its name is Caustic.  Perfectly fusing sing-a-long reckneck anthems with touching, heartfelt ballads that could make the even toughest of cowboys cry themselves to sleep out on the range.  Matt Fanale's expertise on the mouth harp helps redefine what modern country music is all about.   It's also refreshing to have an openly gay member of a country band (Fanale) who's not afraid to wave the pink flag for homosexual equality.    All in all, a wonderful album.",positive,fairness

You could press a button and get canned salsa, carribbean, etc. backbeats. Then you just added your own words and melodies and got a tune! That is what this recording reminds me of, a bunch of people sitting around a synthesizer, making up not very good music.

Lets see, Beethoven's Ninth deserves 5 stars, any Beatles album, some Stones, (not what is currently showing on HBO,) Mozart, Bach, Chopin, Etc... I would be more impressed if those who gave this noise the maximum number of stars would also list 5 other recordings of equal quality;  I could then withhold my negative review and rightfully say, yes, this is incredible.  Alas, this has to be one of the most bombastic thing I have ever heard.  If anyone wants to buy my cd for what I paid, before I throw it in the garbage is welcome.

19,"Sorry, but I am a cultural philistine. I simply don't understand Mozart. I have listened to this CD once the whole way through and none of it made sense at all, so I gave the disc to my grandfather. He listens to music by dead people like Mahler, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Beethoven, Ravel and Bruckner, grown-up stuff that is too complicated for my atom-sized brain. I watch TV all day. The last book I read was 'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown. I prefer watching TV to reading because TV is easier to enjoy. My IQ must seriously be quite low. Anyway, I digress. <br />The point is, I am clueless when it comes to classical music. How does one enjoy it? Just as I gasp with incomprehension at Shakespeare, Picasso and high-culture in general, I am left stupefied, bewildered and ultimately puzzled by this work. I have tried to listen to some of Mozart's other compositions, such as his string quartets and symphonies- my grandfather insists that I will enjoy them- but I have failed like an abject fool to glean any satisfaction. Why? Am I simply too intellectually facile? Do I watch too much MTV? Has the American diet of decadence and dumbing-down irrevocably destroyed every neuron in my brain capable of apprehending masterpieces that old men and women seem to savour? <br />I wish I could enjoy this CD, but it severely bored me. As each movement, each wave of tedium lapped against the impatient shore of my mind, Linkin' Park and other crews called my name. I am a child of the 21st-century and I apologise sincerely for the ignominious inanities of my hyperactive generation. We have the attention-spans of moths, the mental capacity of an oak tree. Yes, this is self-indulgent free association. I just felt like telling the world how forsaken I feel that an entire reservoir, nay, universe of purported masterpieces will forever evade my understanding and appreciation. And yes, I know, this review has been most unhelpful, but I can't help it: I am simply too dumb. Help.",negative,regular

On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh.

All I can say is you must have shipped the wrong CD, as it said Hum on it, but unlike the reviews it was one of the weakest rock albums Ive ever listened to. <br />The songs are very poor, they seem to think that a wall of noise (and I am a huge rock fan so I like volume), can substitute for good and original riffs/songs. Added to that the production values are appalling. Was it recorded in someones front room? The drums are mixed too high, and sound like someone beating biscuit tins with knitting needles and the \\""vocals\\"" are buried deep in the muddy noise. Now - the vocalist. Hands up who thought that the whiney college vocal style of the singer from They Might Be Giants fronting Metallica would make a good combo? No one. Well that is what you get here.<br />Reviewers, you owe me my money back.

84,"Yagya made a big splash -- if one can splash in sub-arctic temperatures -- with RHYTHM OF SNOW. The hymn wears its dub techno influences proudly: \\""Snowflake 1\\"" is all about the background crackle and the long, sustained chords. And while the individual tracks don't differ greatly from one another, the cumulative effect of the hymn is akin to being snowed in; the deep, resonant tones, the beats fluttering by like drifts, the build-up of ice. \\""Snowflake 4\\"" starts to sparkle a little more, and \\""Snowflake 5\\"" almost sounds perky by comparison. The beat of \\""Snowflake 8\\"" seems to emanate from the heart of a melting glacier, and by \\""Snowflake 9,\\"" the beat has broken off and disappeared into the Arctic Ocean. The slow float of \\""Snowflake 6,\\"" though, stands out in particular for its lovely, lush chord progression, which is reprised in \\""Snowflake 10,\\"" though the melody is more filtered. A lovely hymn that stands up to the hype.",positive,invariance

86,"I have never listened to him before when he was in a group. But the single 'Push' captured me and I went ahead and bought the CD. I can say without a doubt, it is one of the best anthem I have listened in a while. Great Job Nick",positive,invariance

91,"Ugh.  When a group wants to experiment, they sometimes make a breakthrough such as the Beatles' White Album.  However, the only similarity between this tripe and the White Album is a monochromatic cover.  <br />This is a lackluster poor excuse for a follow up to their previous albums.  The music is bland, uninteresting and ultimately forgetable.<br />I've only listened to this CD twice.  I've listened to Meteora much more.  <br />Now let's see how P.O.D. ruins themselves next.",negative,regular

94,"there are 18 of Sue's best on this CD. the Collectibles label does a great job on every release. &#34;Norman&#34;, &#34;James (Hold the Latter&#34;, &#34;Bad Boy&#34;, &#34;Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)&#34;, &#34;Paper Tiger&#34;, &#34;My Hero (That's What You Are)&#34;, &#34;I'll Never Love Again&#34; and &#34;Nine Little Teardrops&#34; are the outstanding cuts on this CD. this album is enjoyable from beginning to end. Sue has a sexy voice. the sound quality of this CD is really great. Sue Thompson never put out a bad recording. this is a great introduction to one of the best femail rock stars of the 1950's and 1960's. Sue Thompson could really rock it out.",positive,regular

98,"I bought this CD because I'd heard so many great things written up about this band, esp. in Time Out New York and in Rolling Stone and maybe, between reading what I thought were great reviews and actually purchasing this CD I must have FORGOTTEN the part of the review that would have STOPPED me from buying this CD.<br />I don't mind the MUSIC per se (I can file it sorta under modern country music, akin to Lloyd Cole &amp; The Commotions in the 80s), but I can't stand the lead singer's voice.",negative,regular
99,"Too bad \\""no stars\\"" isn't an option. What an unforgivable insult. Amazon as seller, let alone \\""American Legends\\"" label as distributor should be ashamed.  <br /> <br />None of the semi-legendary ladies featured on the photo are inside. To make matters worse, they sing (if you can call it that) to what sounds, at best, like a cheap karaoke cut of old Supremes classics that I doubt would get very far in \\""those\\"" clubs.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't even line a litter box or birdcage with this travesty. Didn't The Flos learn anything from the failed \\""Return to Love\\"" tour of 2000? Apparently not. At the very least, the estate of Florence Ballard should glean some financial reward for the use of her name in their stupid acronym.",negative,invariance
