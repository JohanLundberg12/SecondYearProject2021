Perfectly fusing sing-a-long reckneck anthems with touching, heartfelt ballads that could make the even toughest of cowboys cry themselves to sleep out on the range.  Matt Fanale's expertise on the mouth harp helps redefine what modern country music is all about.   It's also refreshing to have an openly gay member of a country band (Fanale) who's not afraid to wave the pink flag for homosexual equality.    All in all, a wonderful album.\",\n",

The messages are near and dear to the hearts of children with autism spectrum disorders, but help other kids understand them better. They may find themselves in a song, too. Songs like \\\"picky eater\\\" \\\"Who wants to wear clothes (not me!)\\\" and \\\"(Please don't try to fix me) Love me for who I am\\\" are (as are most) very clever. The words are easy to understand, the music is catchy and performed with lots of energy and enthusiasm. I wish everyone would buy one! The world would be a much better place!\",\n",

Swooping melodies, glissandos in the piano, simple melodies in the soprano, and all tied together by a strong Czech sound and sensibility.  Favorites on the CD are Koleda, and Dve pisne, two songs. <BR>I would strongly recommend buying this cd for listening on a rainy afternoon.  Music students, especially younger singers, are also encouraged to study these songs, as they would make a wonderful addition to a recital.  I am an operatic performer, and I am working on incorporating them into future programs.\",\n",

Their dynamic wants to take the listener to a point where you fully expect the music to really take off and rock out. But it never quite does..leaving you wanting more. Like almost achieving orgasm. They do this quite well on songs like Cross Your Eyes, Blue Eurasians and Fanfare; and the effect approaches excitement.<br />They have a good sound and play well. The main problem is that most of the songs just aren't that strong or involving. <br />Not bad, especially for a debut, but not good enough to make me want to rush out and buy their new release...I'll wait til it shows up in the 'used' bin.\",\n",

Than I head the song 'Daughter' and I learned that Eddie didn't have sympathy for at least one disadvantaged group in America: The mentally handicapped.  On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh.  I'll admit it, his impression is dead on: he totally sounds like a 'tard. But is it really appropriate to mock the mentally handicapped, particularly when one is involved in so many fashionable, liberal causes?  Well, no.
