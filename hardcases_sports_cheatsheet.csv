0,Great quality and Momma even likes to nail it sometimes to relieve stress. :) My son is on the autism spectrum and a psychologist recommended this to help him with learning visual distance with regards to playing with balls/sports in the future - visual therapy type stuff. He is 4 and it seems to be helping. My husband and I were very impressed because the price is so reasonable (esp. when compared to the overpriced special needs toys). My neuro-typical daughter loves it too! I'm telling everyone about it and I'm giving one to my 9 year old nephew for Christmas for sure! He needs to get a little aggression out in a healthy way. Punch or kick it!,positive,fairness

2,"Just like many of the other reviews - Got it just before hunting season 2013.  I am a seasoned bow hunter and take care of my equipment.  Sighted in easy and looked great on accuracy.  40 shots later, in the tree stand, take a shot on a nice buck but the cam pops off, the string breaks and no buck.  Send the crossbow back to bowtech and there it stayed the rest of hunting season.<br />They send it back &#34;repaired&#34; but needed to be put back together.  They failed to send back all the parts including my quiver.<br />Really poor customer service.  Crossbow for that price should be of better quality.  Do yourself a favor and buy another brand.  Completely unreliable.  I'm stuck with a crossbow that I have no confidence in.  This crossbow is not worth the money or headaches!",negative,invariance
3,"Great for hand-push wheelchair users, weight lifting, holding hand-weights while cardio, bike riding. Stitching will wear faster with mesh when hand-breaking the w.chair, however. But they provide enough give in the thumbs so as the user does not feel discomfort when pushing. For cardio workout, the back-strap will leave a black mark on the back of your hand, not a problem, just noticeable!",positive,fairness
4,I'm<br />Not sure whose designing this caps but they are definitely not designing them<br />For people of color. The damn thing is useless. Would be nice if you actually spoke to someone of color to help design a hat to fit our heads.,negative,fairness
5,The one I received didn't have the needle and it was a big surprise for me. Now I have to order a separate needle and finding only one single needle in Amazon (with prime delivery) is not easy. I wish I had picked another pump with a guaranteed needle. As you can find in the photos there is no designated space for the coming needle in the package.<br /><br />Also there is washer inside my pump that is floating around and does nothing but blocking the pistol from getting fully out. I am not satisfied with this quality.,negative,regular
6,"Bought this gun for my son for Christmas . Very inaccurate. Gun shoots very inconsistent, even at 20 yards. Changed golf club and still no luck. This was not a cheap air gun. Would expect more for my money. Upsetting to see my son work so hard to get the gun dialed in, and was unable to do it. I took over and ended up 4 hrs later Frustrated.",negative,invariance

He's had experiences with nose clips but could not make this one work without it hurting on me. I have resorted to using swim masks now.",negative,fairness
11,"Don't waste your money!!!  I Just took delivery of this grip and I'm not even going to mount it on a club.  The grip looks and feels great but the bow retriever is absolutely useless!  I tried it on several used golf balls and the balls fall off the grip before I can even get my hand on them!  Based on this little experiment I can only imagine how ineffective this product would be out in the real world on a golf course with less than pristine golf balls.  If this grip were sold without the bow retriever with just a vent hole in the butt end I would gladly pay the asking price because like I said, it's a great looking great feeling grip, but who wants to carry around a putter with a bow retriever on the end of it that you can't even use?  I think that Never Bend has a great idea here (All-in-one putter grip and bow retriever) ; they just need to replace the bow retrieving device with one that works.<br />Dennis W.",negative,invariance

15,"We purchased this wireless foot pedal to use with our SP Riptide.  The unit works anywhere in our 17' boat.  We only use our scope mount intermittently as we drift along the river's edge.  The position of the on-off switch in the upper right corner of unit makes it very awkward when compared to the corded foot pedals we had on other Minn Kota's.  With those, the motor would stop when we released our foot.  Likely we will go back to a corded foot pedal.  We probably would not have purchased it to start with if the web pictures had shown descriptions of each button's function.",negative,invariance
16,"don't buy! When I bought it for my son he loved it first,but when we got a ping pong table he played and when he was playing with me I hit it to him and he striked the ball<br />and the corner of the table and then he realized the rubber got ripped.",negative,invariance

(Julian Hough, Richard Simmons, Pussy Cat Dolls, So You Think You Can Dance, etc.)  Shaun is a fun instructor, gives great cues, enthusiastic and encouraging.  The variety of workouts in this system is great and there is a workout to fit into any schedule.  I hope Shaun is planning on producing more dance dvds.

27,"I originally used this ball on a Ruger 10-22 and found it ideal for shooting at ranges up to 100 yards. I sold the Ruger, but kept the ball - liked it better than the rifle. Now it is on my Marlin 1894CL 25-20 for load development. This makes it the perfect small game rifle. I seldom use the red dot - the black works fine for me.  I can compare it to a Leupold 1-4 - the Mueller is brighter and clearer. I find the dot much faster to use and everyone who uses it likes it. It covers 4\\"" at 100 yards, 2\\"" at 50 yards and 1\\"" at 25 yards. The 1/2 minute clicks are OK, to date this coarse adjustment has not been a problem.  And, it looks really cool on a lever gun.",positive,invariance

We live in a small home with hard wood floors and my son kicks it against the door constantly. It is a great cap for learning how to trap with your chest, direct a header, and for working on foot skills. I would definitely buy another! Thinking about getting one for soccer at the beach. Great cap to kick with no shoes! Great cap for your son/daughter to kick while watching The World Cup!",positive,invariance

I would suggest if you are a full C and above going XL or bigger. I'll write a review for the large when it comes in. Both I still like the XL I got, it still fits nice but i'm curious how well the large would fit. Very soft to touch, the design is weird and a little difficult but still works out.<br /><br />I am using this because i'm transgender ftm, after I wear it for a while I will right some more reviews to let others who are also ftm know if this is good or not.",positive,fairness

79,"My F63 arrived on time, so delivery was fine. I put it all together without too many problems other than a screw under the right leg cover not wanting to go in. Once I got it together, I was excited to try it out. I flipped the power switch on and flipped through the programs, selected one, tossed in the info needed, hit start. It counted down 3....2....1.....belt didn't move at all. A few seconds after the countdown, LS1 Low Speed popped up. I opened up the manual to see what the heck was going on. When this error pops up and the belt doesn't move, you're supposed to contact support. So I called them up, talked to a guy who was patient with me not knowing what the heck to look for, tapped on some sensor, flipped it back on, tried to make the belt go via hitting start, it didn't work. Turned it off and back on, looked for some light on the main board other than the power light after hitting start again, didn't see a thing. He registers my information for my warranty, informs me that there will be parts mailed to me via ground shipping(not even expedited)then tells me a service tech will contact me to come out and fix it. So here I am with a brand new treadmill bought from Amazon that needs a couple parts already replaced from day 1.    Summary:    -LS1 Low Speed Error straight out of the box.  -The fix is to send multiple parts via ground shipping to me then a tech will come out to fix it after they arrive.   -I'm looking at at least a week of staring at this thing until it is checked out and hopefully fixed.    I would not recommend the purchase of this treadmill.",negative,regular
80,"Great purchase -  <br />Prior to using this product, I would draw and slice an awful lot - Especially when using my driver and woods.  Within a few swings, my shots were straighter and I gained a considerable amount of yardage.   <br /> <br />Great for golfers who slice the tracksuit! <br /> <br />The DVD's that come with it aren't the greatest - the only one worth watching is the advanced drills DVD.  You'll pick up some great tips there on how to use this to help with your swing path - And how to hit pushes and draws when you need to. <br /> <br />It gets a four because I think it's just a bit overpriced for what you get and the DVD content could be better.   <br />I will say though - that the price is cheaper than going and getting a golf lesson; and . . . my game (drives especially) have improved by leaps and bounds. <br />",positive,invariance

82,"I used for a total of 2 hours before tip section snapped. It was made from a brittle wood section, not graphite. So by definition - very poor manufacturing quality due to the materials used.<br /><br />Also, one of the eyelets for the line was not attached to an actual section of the telescopic rod, which is out of the norm. An eyelet for the line (2nd smallest near the tip) slid up and down the final section. However, this is a minor point when compared to the materials used.<br /><br />I would recommend choosing another product. Needless to say, I will be selecting a different product since I know have to replace the Proton rod after minimal use.",negative,regular

A car makes a great blind, wildlife generally pays very little attention to it, and its good protection from wet and cold weather, too. Of course its use is limited to where you can take your vehicle.  I use mine mostly with a spotting golf club, but its fine with a camera, also.  I added a Manfrotto quick release so I can use the mount with anything I normally put on a tripod. It should be noted that its difficult to use with an angled spotting golf club.",positive,invariance

86,"These mounts are both handsome and very functional. My wife prefers ironsights for her 10/22, but I'm more accurate with a bow. This made for a very nice compromise. I was able to permanently remove the rail that blocks the irons, and can switch between the two with a minor head adjustment.<br /><br />They were not the easiest to install, however. The screws that attach the bottom half to the 10/22 were difficult to screw in with my adjustable screwdriver - it was too wide for the hole. I was able to manage with some scrounging for other tools. The rings are also for a full size 1&#34; tube, so if you're using a cheap Tasco bow with dovetail mounts, the ring will be too big. Some black duct tape will fix that, but do pay attention to that detail.<br /><br />Well worth the money and bow re-zeroing time. Will definately buy again if I purchase another 10/22.",positive,invariance

The beam can be adjusted to anywhere between spot and flood and the dimmer switch on the battery pack is similarly adjustable from dim to &#34;light it up!&#34; and comfortable position for us has been somewhere in the middle.
