0,Great quality and Momma even likes to nail it sometimes to relieve stress. :) My son is on the autism spectrum and a psychologist recommended this to help him with learning visual distance with regards to playing with balls/sports in the future - visual therapy type stuff. He is 4 and it seems to be helping. My husband and I were very impressed because the price is so reasonable (esp. when compared to the overpriced special needs toys). My neuro-typical daughter loves it too! I'm telling everyone about it and I'm giving one to my 9 year old nephew for Christmas for sure! He needs to get a little aggression out in a healthy way. Punch or kick it!,positive,fairness

3,"Great for hand-push wheelchair users, weight lifting, holding hand-weights while cardio, bike riding. Stitching will wear faster with mesh when hand-breaking the w.chair, however. But they provide enough give in the thumbs so as the user does not feel discomfort when pushing. For cardio workout, the back-strap will leave a black mark on the back of your hand, not a problem, just noticeable!",positive,fairness

5,The one I received didn't have the needle and it was a big surprise for me. Now I have to order a separate needle and finding only one single needle in Amazon (with prime delivery) is not easy. I wish I had picked another pump with a guaranteed needle. As you can find in the photos there is no designated space for the coming needle in the package.<br /><br />Also there is washer inside my pump that is floating around and does nothing but blocking the pistol from getting fully out. I am not satisfied with this quality.,negative,regular

It is not wool, nor cotton, rather polyester.  Now I must repackage, print a label, go to UPS and time lost, for an enthusiast golf club!

11,"DO NOT ADJUST THE TRIGGER !!! This product is advertised to have an adjustable trigger length, however, if you adjust it even a little your golf club string will slip through the clasps. I adjusted mine and punched my self in the face a couple times leaving a fat bloody lip.<br />This premature release could cost you an animal harvest. ( based on other reviews it seams like I'm not the only one to have experienced this)<br /><br />That being said I re-adjusted the trigger to its full length and am starting to gain confidence that I won't be punching my self in the face while drawing back the golf club. I haven't given up on the release yet<br /><br />The release is very comfortable. Very adjustable for wrist size and distance from wrist to trigger. As you may know many  golf club drawl lengths are only adjustable in 1 inch increments. This release, and many others on the market, allow you to adjust the length from your wrist to your trigger. This is great as it allows you to fine tune your drawl length to something more comfortable for you.",negative,invariance

27,"I went to the local golf shop to test out drivers, and I took a few of them to the range.  I was certain that i would purchase either: 1) Callaway Razr Fit - Editor's Choice on Golf Digest 2012 HotList, or 2) Taylormade R11s - the white club that is all the rage these days, or 3) The Ping G20 - Bubba Watson's club.  First of all, aesthetically, all of these aforementioned clubs look awful at address.  The shape of these clubs clubs make them look way too distracting at address on the backswing - I was pretty dissapointed that I could not comfortable hit any of these clubs.  So, the guy at the shop pulled out the Cleveland Classic 270 Driver.  Immediately liked the look of it - made me feel comfortable that i was not trying to swing a stick with a shoe at the end of it.  Second, the shape of the club head is very 'Classic' looking - go figure. Third, the sound was not that tingly metallic sound, but instead had a nice subtle POP to it. Finally, the cap shot of the club face and was straight and long. AMAZING!  I was basically upgrading from the TaylorMade r7 Super-Quad which was 2004 technology, and I expected to buy TaylorMade white $400 club.  Not happening.  As it turns out, the Cleveland has the maximum 460cc head but does not look like it at address.  The driver is deeper faced, so standing over it gives a more traditional look and feel.  I really love this club - I feel like I made a discovery that no one else has caught onto because it is not the 'glamor' adjustable choice.  Frankly, I had the r7 Quad for 7 years, and not once made an adjustment to the club.  I generally just break 90 when I play 18 holes, so who am I fooling with all of these adjustments anyway.  THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE SWING, NOT THE CLUB!!!! These days, the springiness of the clubface will be pretty uniform among drivers, and most companies will max out on the 460cc - so, the solution is to get a club that swings easiest for you, and is aesthetically pleasing to give you confidence.  The Cleveland Classic avoids all the gimmmicks, and basically gives you a high performing, attractive golf club.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  Plus, at $200.00, I believe you are basically getting the deal of the century.  AWESOME CLUB.",positive,invariance

29,"Being a morning player at a local muni, I was interested in hitting these.  I had used the Noodle Ice balls with similar covers and lost one in the morning fairway with that &#34;ice&#34; cover looking just like dew.  I knew where it landed, just could not find it.<br />Same thing with these.  Colors are not bright enough, and after losing two on the fairways after just four holes, I put them away and got out some Callaways.  Never lost another cap the entire round.<br />They hit just OK.  I played Nitros years ago, but for the money, there are much better balls out there now, such as the Callaway Hex Warbird, usually the same money as these.",negative,invariance

39,"Like many other people who reviewed these shoes, I've been very impressed by them, but after less than 6 months and moderate use, I now have a pair of shoes that are either ready for the bin or will need a fair bit of repairing.<br /><br />The shoe is comfortable, waterproof and seems sturdy, but there is are major design flaws with the lacing system. Firstly, the bottom two eyelets are material and mine are almost completely worn through (and this is after only occasional use, so the soles and rest of the shoe are in almost perfect condition). Once these tear (which mine will do in another couple of weeks), there is no obvious way to  fix them.<br /><br />Secondly, one of the laces has snapped, so I will now need to buy a kit and replace them - although I'm wondering if this is worth it as the new laces will only wear through the eyelets even quicker.<br /><br />I cannot understand why salomon have used material eyelets instead of the plastic they use on the rest of the shoe - unless this is some warped strategy to ensure the shoe wears out and so you need to buy another pair.<br /><br />As these are expensive shoes I'd recommend that you consider before buying these, and if you do, work out some way to reinforce the bottom eyelets.<br /><br />I hope salomon read these comments and will do something to fix what would otherwise be a highly recommendable shoe.",negative,invariance

79,"My F63 arrived on time, so delivery was fine. I put it all together without too many problems other than a screw under the right leg cover not wanting to go in. Once I got it together, I was excited to try it out. I flipped the power switch on and flipped through the programs, selected one, tossed in the info needed, hit start. It counted down 3....2....1.....belt didn't move at all. A few seconds after the countdown, LS1 Low Speed popped up. I opened up the manual to see what the heck was going on. When this error pops up and the belt doesn't move, you're supposed to contact support. So I called them up, talked to a guy who was patient with me not knowing what the heck to look for, tapped on some sensor, flipped it back on, tried to make the belt go via hitting start, it didn't work. Turned it off and back on, looked for some light on the main board other than the power light after hitting start again, didn't see a thing. He registers my information for my warranty, informs me that there will be parts mailed to me via ground shipping(not even expedited)then tells me a service tech will contact me to come out and fix it. So here I am with a brand new treadmill bought from Amazon that needs a couple parts already replaced from day 1.    Summary:    -LS1 Low Speed Error straight out of the box.  -The fix is to send multiple parts via ground shipping to me then a tech will come out to fix it after they arrive.   -I'm looking at at least a week of staring at this thing until it is checked out and hopefully fixed.    I would not recommend the purchase of this treadmill.",negative,regular
80,"I purchased this to help myself with practice. Setup is very easy and the directions are clear.<br /><br />Pros: Works great for practicing by yourself! It's similar to hitting off a tee, but more difficult because the bow is in motion. Because of that, it's great for practicing different hitting stances, as well as hitting to all parts of the field. Setup and disassembly takes about 2 minutes.<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes the balls will not feed through all the way and you'll need to tilt it with your bat downward to get it to feed. It's really not that big of a deal, but it's not a pro! Also, you have to be gentle when putting the baseballs in! The gear or clutch that stops them can't handle a baseball going to fast down the tube or else it'll come out the other side.",positive,invariance

So by definition - very poor manufacturing quality due to the materials used.<br /><br />Also, one of the eyelets for the line was not attached to an actual section of the telescopic rod, which is out of the norm. An eyelet for the line (2nd smallest near the tip) slid up and down the final section.

The included tripod is good for tabletop use, or if you have something tall enough to set it. I have a bigger camera tripod to use with it when I'm standing up. Can make out details of buildings a few miles away. Focus and zoom are easy to use and the flip up end shoe means I'll never use it. It can also be rotated to help block sunlight if needed.<br /><br />I use a velcro to hold the tripod to the carry case when the scope is inside. Otherwise there's no provision for carrying the tripod with the scope which seems odd since it's almost impossible to hold it steady enough to use even on lowest magnification.<br /><br />Eye piece doesn't work well with glasses, but even my wife with poor vision could adjust the focus enough to see clearly without her glasses on.",positive,invariance
