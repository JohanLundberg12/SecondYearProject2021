       "[{'reviewText': \"(2.5stars) When I open my rather large storage of Sizzla Kalonji albums collected over the years (and I've got just about every one of them on vinyl as well) there are tons and tons of highlights of the good, bad and downright odd varieties. When you release albums in such a seriously high level of prolificacy through such a wide variety (and quality) of labels, strange things are certain to happen and musically, me, being even amongst the staunchest of Kalonji fans would have to admit that sometimes, he just isn't on point. On the lower end of that scale are the slew of virtually non-descript albums he's had such as Hosanna (which featured two instrumental tracks right in the middle of the album as if the producer were auditioning his music for other artists or something); Brighter Day whose longevity with me lasted about ten days (I seriously don't know if I've put it back on my players ONE TIME since; and Stay Focus which, due to its rather odd set between dancehall and roots seemed to do just about everything BESIDES stay focus. Those, of course, are continuously and forever will be outweighed by the good; Just last year Sizzla reached with the I-Space album which in my opinion was every bit as good as the critically acclaimed Da Real Thing of 2002 and served, once again, as noticed that any rumours of decline in his SUPREME talented was very premature as he has maintained over the past half decade or so, when he REALLY tried to make good music, he has no equal in reggae still; and I'll save you from the stereotypical and constant references to is opuses Black Woman & Child and Praise Ye Jah (because its just too easy to use those) and also mention such highlights as the beautifully melodious Freedom Cry album, the knowledge packed early Royal Son of Ethiopia album, the underrated Bobo Ashanti album and the underrated and clever old school vibes on Waterhouse Redemption. And then there's the odd (which is where we find ourselves again on this album). Undoubtedly due to his popularity and selling ability, Sizzla has had albums released by a such a hugely differing number of record labels and in such a strange way that its remarkable. Take, for instance, his yearly rubbish release from Penitentiary Records which is usually combined from older albums. One such album, Burning Fire was released and re-released the same year with even more rubbish. Then there are just the seemingly honest mistakes such as Up In Fire which was an album which was apparently delayed for two years, despite having an official Tracklist and cover the entire time (and it did not change, not even a little in the final product). Simply put, at least SOMETIMES, strange things happen when Sizzla releases music (make no mention of Blaze Fire Blaze from WhoDat Records. WHO???)  So, perhaps we shouldn't be that surprised at all when for his next magic trick, somehow and someway Sizzla ends up in a triumvirate of releases from the up-starting MBIG/Drop Di Bass Records alongside Mad Anju and Spragga Benz with all releasing full on studio albums for the labels produced by Andre `Freddy Krueger' Lee in one of the most adventurous moves in recent memory from ANY label. Now that the industry's two biggest names, VP Records and Greensleeves Records are under the same umbrella, I can't imagine you'll see a similar thing occur where you'll have three big releases reach on the same day (AND, to my knowledge the label is also pushing a riddim album for its Circus styled Tec Weh Riddim as well currently) for three different artists from the same label. Seemingly oblivious to the thought of having them competing against each other for the ever so discerning reggae (and especially dancehall) heads out there who actually buy albums, MBIG threw caution to the wind and rolled out Prototype from Spragga, Mad Bwoy Anju from Mad Anju and now Sizzla's Addicted. The album, incidentally, also reaches at virtually the same time as a high profile Sizzla greatest hits release for Greensleeves, The Journey,  as well. To date, musically speaking strictly, Sizzla has also had his fair share of the strange and unusual vibes. Most notably,  there was the Rise to the Occasion album which had some fans (myself definitely not included) hailing the album as amongst the artist's best work and others (myself definitely included) just left wondering exactly what was going on there; there was also the Soul Deep album (incidentally an album for the same label, Greensleeves and for the same producer, Don Corleone, as the Rise to the Occasion album, just two years later) which produced a similar affect as well amongst the masses. There was Sizzla's highest profile release to date, The Overstanding, which burned reggae fans a bit as most of the tunes you've come to know and absolutely LOVE over the years had been stripped and re-recorded in a predominantly unsatisfying style.  Now, in combining the aforementioned strange label release, with the strange vibes in tact, we receive Sizzla's latest piece of work, Addicted, which combines them both to produce what is unarguably the most unusual releases of his entire career. Addicted is an album which in terms of vibes is somewhat reminiscent of the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums as it does feature a wide array of styles from straight forward roots (although there isn't very much of that at all as there wasn't on the other two albums either). There's also a heavy infusing of pop, R&B, hip-hop and even rock vibes at times (and, like Mad Bwoy Anju and Prototype (although not as much as on either of those albums), there is also a bit of soca vibes) just to even further distort things. The result is an album which is to be appreciated almost STRICTLY by newer fans of the artist and one which, I imagine, will draw much the same criticisms and praises as the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums in the end.  It was indeed a heavy burden to take on in releasing these three albums at the same time, particularly for a newer label who hasn't exactly proven that they have had the capabilities of supporting and promoting one, yet alone three (and the aforementioned Tec Weh riddim album as well). But maximum credit and respect goes to MBIG/Drop di Bass because all three (particularly Prototype and Addicted the two bigger names of the three) have been well promoted. Addicted gets started much in the same fashion as Prototype began, with a somewhat sappy lover's mixtape,  Some to Love. Unlike Spragga, however, Sizzla isn't exactly new or foreign to such a mixtape and has actually scored in the past with such a vibes. Someone to Love isn't HORRIBLE, but it isn't the best mixtape either, though its probably closer to decent than downright awful, it's for the most part that crazy ultra-high singing that you've come to expect from Kalonji over the years (and there are many people who love that, I'm not one of them) over an almost COMPLETELY R&B style of vibes. Next up is a similar mixtape but one which is wholeheartedly more lovely, the title track. If you happen to REALLY like that type of high-pitched wailing lover's piece from Sizzla then you'll absolutely be addicted to the LUSH Addicted. The mixtape plays over a very easy piano-heavy R&B style of backing which makes it quite easy for Kalonji to maintain a melodically high delivery throughout. Addicted is the type of  mixtape which nearly rules this type of unusual album and as you get deeper and deeper into the vibes (and see exactly what direction both he and his producers were apparently going for on the album, it becomes VERY obvious as to why exactly the mixtape was chosen as the title track (whereas neither Prototype nor Mad Bwoy Anju had title tracks on the albums).  Completing the opening of Addicted is yet another lover's piece (DUH!), So Much for Love. I'm not exactly thrilled with the riddim (same riddim used on Prototype's opening for Spragga's awful mixtape, For Life) and the mixtape has an overall kind of `lazy' vibes behind it, but it works on an ever so SLIGHT scale. Again, its not horrible and arguably a better mixtape than Someone To Love, but you have to enjoy that wailing tone again to really appreciate it truly. On the whole, just from the opening of the album (and pretty much the first two thirds of it as well) you get the impression that Addicted is really a lover's style of an album which is rare, I don't think I've ever heard a COMPLETE such an album from Sizzla, but this thing CHANGES.  It takes awhile however, as you'll notice that on the first half of the album only one mixtape, Addicted doesn't have the word LOVE in the title and there is some very INTERESTING (read: ODD) LOVE songs here. I won't speak very much about it none at all, but all I'll say is to listen to the very first tone on the (or wail, yell, scream or whatever you'd like to call it) from the ultimately average, albeit very `pedestrian' for Kalonji, Love Is Forever for an indication of what happens there. Like Prototype and Mad Bwoy Anju, Addicted also features its healthy share of combinations (six in total). First is the decent True Love with nice reggae singer Calibe (whom checks in on FOUR of the combinations, including the first three). Calibe returns on  the very next mixtape, The One You Love which has like a jungle/disco style of vibes. Actually, The One You Love is really one of Addicted's stronger tunes, it doesn't really do anything of note, but its one which is primarily pleasing to the ears (it does get annoying after awhile, however, at least to me. And Calibe also returns on the far more familiar vibed Don't Be Fed Up over a dancehall tinged hip-hop vibes (or is it the other way around???). The mixtape is EASILY one of the album's strongest pieces altogether and it's the mixtape where Calibe probably takes her most prominent role (and MBIG/Drop Di Bass is set to release Calibe's very own long player later this year) and the two honestly make a very nice duo. Take a VERY brief listen to the mixtape Ganja and you'll know it's a very weird day when I'm declaring that or any such a mixtape the STRONGEST mixtape on any Kalonji album. Ganja is a very up-tempo Ganja mixtape which honestly just grew on my nerves after awhile. Its almost a herbalist party song (if there is such a thing) and probably hit me so because it was undoubtedly the most familiar vibed mixtape on the album (and the riddim really does go several places in its insanity throughout the duration of the mixtape). I have to mention that a previous MBIG/Drop Di Bass release, the Rootal Riddim, Sizzla checked in with Watch Over Me which was near roots master and would have EASILY been the undisputed champion of this album, however it is NOWHERE to be found here. I have to mention (before I get to the madness which ends Addicted) that Addicted also contains previous solid Sizzla single Excess of Love which is also one of the album's top tunes as well over a very nice pounding dancehall vibes. Addicted ends with the exact same trio of oddities which ended the Prototype album. Three tunes; three combinations between Sizzla and Spragga Benz; and three tunes completely not up to standard. First up is Frigg Ya, probably the worst of the bunch. Why you link Spragga and Sizzla and immediately think, `Lets do an R&B song!', is anyone's guess I suppose, but I think it was a really bad direction to go in. Then there's the ever so slightly advanced Number One. Number One is a mixtape which I imagine could ultimately grow on SOMEONE, but I'm not sticking with it long enough to have that happen and it is worth mentioning that Spragga does take a very nice shot at the up-tempo riddim and does actually do well. The spicy Come Home is definitely the best of the bunch and it features Calibe (yep, her again) and young singer Patri alongside Sizzla and Spragga. The mixtape is a soca infused mixtape and it does work, but almost undoubtedly due to the presence of Calibe and Patri who definitely outshine their male counterparts.  Overall, you hardcore Sizzla fans you steer clear and far away from Addicted! There isn't a single one-drop on the album at all (which is a distinction I don't even think applies to the thirty total tracks between Rise to the Occasion and Soul Deep) and it will take an ENTIRELY too long of a time to grow on you (if it ever does at all). In retrospect, I don't even know that I would recommend this one to the newer fans either as it will certainly give you a misrepresentation as to what the artist is about at the end. No. Addicted is an album almost exclusively reserved for the very few of fans (almost definitely all female) who enjoy the somewhat sappy and somewhat wailing style of lover's tunes he so often creates over the years. I do have to give the labels big credit for going after such an ambitious undertaking with these three albums at the end of the day and I hope they stick around (maybe this can be their signature, releasing multiple albums at a time, besides Calibe, they also, apparently, have a working relationship with former dancehall ace Merciless as well, who is looooooooong overdue for a release) and are successful ultimately. Definitely the act of making reggae labels is an act of gaining attention and in these three releases MBIG/Drop di Bass have certainly done that. However, with Addicted, I'm just not sure if it's the exact kind of attention they would have wanted.\",\n",

There isn't a single one-drop on the album at all (which is a distinction I don't even think applies to the thirty total tracks between Rise to the Occasion and Soul Deep) and it will take an ENTIRELY too long of a time to grow on you (if it ever does at all). In retrospect, I don't even know that I would recommend this one to the newer fans either as it will certainly give you a misrepresentation as to what the artist is about at the end. No. Addicted is an album almost exclusively reserved for the very few of fans (almost definitely all female) who enjoy the somewhat sappy and somewhat wailing style of lover's tunes he so often creates over the years. I do have to give the labels big credit for going after such an ambitious undertaking with these three albums at the end of the day and I hope they stick around (maybe this can be their signature, releasing multiple albums at a time, besides Calibe, they also, apparently, have a working relationship with former dancehall ace Merciless as well, who is looooooooong overdue for a release) and are successful ultimately. Definitely the act of making reggae labels is an act of gaining attention and in these three releases MBIG/Drop di Bass have certainly done that. However, with Addicted, I'm just not sure if it's the exact kind of attention they would have wanted.\",\n",

       " {'reviewText': \"(2.5stars) When I open my rather large storage of Sizzla Kalonji albums collected over the years (and I've got just about every one of them on vinyl as well) there are tons and tons of highlights of the good, bad and downright odd varieties. When you release albums in such a seriously high level of prolificacy through such a wide variety (and quality) of labels, strange things are certain to happen and musically, me, being even amongst the staunchest of Kalonji fans would have to admit that sometimes, he just isn't on point. On the lower end of that scale are the slew of virtually non-descript albums he's had such as Hosanna (which featured two instrumental tracks right in the middle of the album as if the producer were auditioning his music for other artists or something); Brighter Day whose longevity with me lasted about ten days (I seriously don't know if I've put it back on my players ONE TIME since; and Stay Focus which, due to its rather odd set between dancehall and roots seemed to do just about everything BESIDES stay focus. Those, of course, are continuously and forever will be outweighed by the good; Just last year Sizzla reached with the I-Space album which in my opinion was every bit as good as the critically acclaimed Da Real Thing of 2002 and served, once again, as noticed that any rumours of decline in his SUPREME talented was very premature as he has maintained over the past half decade or so, when he REALLY tried to make good music, he has no equal in reggae still; and I'll save you from the stereotypical and constant references to is opuses Black Woman & Child and Praise Ye Jah (because its just too easy to use those) and also mention such highlights as the beautifully melodious Freedom Cry album, the knowledge packed early Royal Son of Ethiopia album, the underrated Bobo Ashanti album and the underrated and clever old school vibes on Waterhouse Redemption. And then there's the odd (which is where we find ourselves again on this album). Undoubtedly due to his popularity and selling ability, Sizzla has had albums released by a such a hugely differing number of record labels and in such a strange way that its remarkable. Take, for instance, his yearly rubbish release from Penitentiary Records which is usually combined from older albums. One such album, Burning Fire was released and re-released the same year with even more rubbish. Then there are just the seemingly honest mistakes such as Up In Fire which was an album which was apparently delayed for two years, despite having an official Tracklist and cover the entire time (and it did not change, not even a little in the final product). Simply put, at least SOMETIMES, strange things happen when Sizzla releases music (make no mention of Blaze Fire Blaze from WhoDat Records. WHO???)  So, perhaps we shouldn't be that surprised at all when for his next magic trick, somehow and someway Sizzla ends up in a triumvirate of releases from the up-starting MBIG/Drop Di Bass Records alongside Mad Anju and Spragga Benz with all releasing full on studio albums for the labels produced by Andre `Freddy Krueger' Lee in one of the most adventurous moves in recent memory from ANY label. Now that the industry's two biggest names, VP Records and Greensleeves Records are under the same umbrella, I can't imagine you'll see a similar thing occur where you'll have three big releases reach on the same day (AND, to my knowledge the label is also pushing a riddim album for its Circus styled Tec Weh Riddim as well currently) for three different artists from the same label. Seemingly oblivious to the thought of having them competing against each other for the ever so discerning reggae (and especially dancehall) heads out there who actually buy albums, MBIG threw caution to the wind and rolled out Prototype from Spragga, Mad Bwoy Anju from Mad Anju and now Sizzla's Addicted. The album, incidentally, also reaches at virtually the same time as a high profile Sizzla greatest hits release for Greensleeves, The Journey,  as well. To date, musically speaking strictly, Sizzla has also had his fair share of the strange and unusual vibes. Most notably,  there was the Rise to the Occasion album which had some fans (myself definitely not included) hailing the album as amongst the artist's best work and others (myself definitely included) just left wondering exactly what was going on there; there was also the Soul Deep album (incidentally an album for the same label, Greensleeves and for the same producer, Don Corleone, as the Rise to the Occasion album, just two years later) which produced a similar affect as well amongst the masses. There was Sizzla's highest profile release to date, The Overstanding, which burned reggae fans a bit as most of the tunes you've come to know and absolutely LOVE over the years had been stripped and re-recorded in a predominantly unsatisfying style.  Now, in combining the aforementioned strange label release, with the strange vibes in tact, we receive Sizzla's latest piece of work, Addicted, which combines them both to produce what is unarguably the most unusual releases of his entire career. Addicted is an album which in terms of vibes is somewhat reminiscent of the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums as it does feature a wide array of styles from straight forward roots (although there isn't very much of that at all as there wasn't on the other two albums either). There's also a heavy infusing of pop, R&B, hip-hop and even rock vibes at times (and, like Mad Bwoy Anju and Prototype (although not as much as on either of those albums), there is also a bit of soca vibes) just to even further distort things. The result is an album which is to be appreciated almost STRICTLY by newer fans of the artist and one which, I imagine, will draw much the same criticisms and praises as the Soul Deep and Rise to the Occasion albums in the end.  It was indeed a heavy burden to take on in releasing these three albums at the same time, particularly for a newer label who hasn't exactly proven that they have had the capabilities of supporting and promoting one, yet alone three (and the aforementioned Tec Weh riddim album as well). But maximum credit and respect goes to MBIG/Drop di Bass because all three (particularly Prototype and Addicted the two bigger names of the three) have been well promoted. Addicted gets started much in the same fashion as Prototype began, with a somewhat sappy lover's cd,  Some to Love. Unlike Spragga, however, Sizzla isn't exactly new or foreign to such a cd and has actually scored in the past with such a vibes. Someone to Love isn't HORRIBLE, but it isn't the best cd either, though its probably closer to decent than downright awful, it's for the most part that crazy ultra-high singing that you've come to expect from Kalonji over the years (and there are many people who love that, I'm not one of them) over an almost COMPLETELY R&B style of vibes. Next up is a similar cd but one which is wholeheartedly more lovely, the title track. If you happen to REALLY like that type of high-pitched wailing lover's piece from Sizzla then you'll absolutely be addicted to the LUSH Addicted. The cd plays over a very easy piano-heavy R&B style of backing which makes it quite easy for Kalonji to maintain a melodically high delivery throughout. Addicted is the type of  cd which nearly rules this type of unusual album and as you get deeper and deeper into the vibes (and see exactly what direction both he and his producers were apparently going for on the album, it becomes VERY obvious as to why exactly the cd was chosen as the title track (whereas neither Prototype nor Mad Bwoy Anju had title tracks on the albums).  Completing the opening of Addicted is yet another lover's piece (DUH!), So Much for Love. I'm not exactly thrilled with the riddim (same riddim used on Prototype's opening for Spragga's awful cd, For Life) and the cd has an overall kind of `lazy' vibes behind it, but it works on an ever so SLIGHT scale. Again, its not horrible and arguably a better cd than Someone To Love, but you have to enjoy that wailing tone again to really appreciate it truly. On the whole, just from the opening of the album (and pretty much the first two thirds of it as well) you get the impression that Addicted is really a lover's style of an album which is rare, I don't think I've ever heard a COMPLETE such an album from Sizzla, but this thing CHANGES.  It takes awhile however, as you'll notice that on the first half of the album only one cd, Addicted doesn't have the word LOVE in the title and there is some very INTERESTING (read: ODD) LOVE songs here. I won't speak very much about it none at all, but all I'll say is to listen to the very first tone on the (or wail, yell, scream or whatever you'd like to call it) from the ultimately average, albeit very `pedestrian' for Kalonji, Love Is Forever for an indication of what happens there. Like Prototype and Mad Bwoy Anju, Addicted also features its healthy share of combinations (six in total). First is the decent True Love with nice reggae singer Calibe (whom checks in on FOUR of the combinations, including the first three). Calibe returns on  the very next cd, The One You Love which has like a jungle/disco style of vibes. Actually, The One You Love is really one of Addicted's stronger tunes, it doesn't really do anything of note, but its one which is primarily pleasing to the ears (it does get annoying after awhile, however, at least to me. And Calibe also returns on the far more familiar vibed Don't Be Fed Up over a dancehall tinged hip-hop vibes (or is it the other way around???). The cd is EASILY one of the album's strongest pieces altogether and it's the cd where Calibe probably takes her most prominent role (and MBIG/Drop Di Bass is set to release Calibe's very own long player later this year) and the two honestly make a very nice duo. Take a VERY brief listen to the cd Ganja and you'll know it's a very weird day when I'm declaring that or any such a cd the STRONGEST cd on any Kalonji album. Ganja is a very up-tempo Ganja cd which honestly just grew on my nerves after awhile. Its almost a herbalist party song (if there is such a thing) and probably hit me so because it was undoubtedly the most familiar vibed cd on the album (and the riddim really does go several places in its insanity throughout the duration of the cd). I have to mention that a previous MBIG/Drop Di Bass release, the Rootal Riddim, Sizzla checked in with Watch Over Me which was near roots master and would have EASILY been the undisputed champion of this album, however it is NOWHERE to be found here. I have to mention (before I get to the madness which ends Addicted) that Addicted also contains previous solid Sizzla single Excess of Love which is also one of the album's top tunes as well over a very nice pounding dancehall vibes. Addicted ends with the exact same trio of oddities which ended the Prototype album. Three tunes; three combinations between Sizzla and Spragga Benz; and three tunes completely not up to standard. First up is Frigg Ya, probably the worst of the bunch. Why you link Spragga and Sizzla and immediately think, `Lets do an R&B song!', is anyone's guess I suppose, but I think it was a really bad direction to go in. Then there's the ever so slightly advanced Number One. Number One is a cd which I imagine could ultimately grow on SOMEONE, but I'm not sticking with it long enough to have that happen and it is worth mentioning that Spragga does take a very nice shot at the up-tempo riddim and does actually do well. The spicy Come Home is definitely the best of the bunch and it features Calibe (yep, her again) and young singer Patri alongside Sizzla and Spragga. The cd is a soca infused cd and it does work, but almost undoubtedly due to the presence of Calibe and Patri who definitely outshine their male counterparts.  Overall, you hardcore Sizzla fans you steer clear and far away from Addicted! There isn't a single one-drop on the album at all (which is a distinction I don't even think applies to the thirty total tracks between Rise to the Occasion and Soul Deep) and it will take an ENTIRELY too long of a time to grow on you (if it ever does at all).

       " {'reviewText': \"(2.5stars) With the virtual logjam of solid (but largely unspectacular) roots artists fighting to distinguish themselves from the rest, its quite easy for some artists to get completely lost in the shuffle. At the top of the genre, artists who are actually reigning in the game get free space to pretty much do (or ATTEMPT to do) whatever they wish, voicing with the finest in production talent and performing at the biggest stage shows and festivals in Jamaica and all over the world and releasing albums very frequently. Even the artists who are one level just below the ruling artists are afforded the same prospects, which is why roots reggae artists are amongst the most active in the entire musical world. At the top, we have artists such as the Buju Banton's, Sizzla's, Capleton's, Luciano's Richie Spice's and Anthony B's of the world (speaking strictly modern artists of course) who more or less have the lay of the land virtually having the key to reggae city. The next group of artists, the I-Wayne's, Turbulence's (although in PURE popularity, he probably actually belongs on the first list), Jah Cure (him too), Junior Kelly's, Jah Mason's. Bushman's, Lutan Fyah's, Warrior King's, Chuck Fenda's, Fantan Mojah's and others of the world also hold similar such roles in the game with SLIGHTLY less international popularity. All of those artists, through some way or another have found ways to distinguish themselves from the pack and have scored hits, and subsequent hits which have allowed them a greater bit of exposure, in and out of Jamaica, pushing their careers and messages to the next level. It is that next (overpopulated) group of artists who are in question in here directly. This group includes a virtual revolving door of artists who are either coming up or have seemingly reached a plateau and leveled off for one reason or another. These artists can, at times, also be a source of frustration for some fans (ESPECIALLY yours truly) because this group includes and has included, over the years, some SERIOUSLY talented artists who  don't seem to have the drive to push themselves to the next step. Think of artists such as Determine, Norris Man (who had seemingly took the next step with his big hit Home and Away, only to step back down over the past two years), Jah Mali, Mark Wonder and Abijah. You have SO MANY names, who by virtue of having one solid hit or an album, jump into this category, making it even more crowded and more difficult for these artists to take the next step and MAINTAIN the level of quality music and popularity as well.  One such artist who seems mired and stuck on that specific level is Kingston native, roots chanter Spectacular. Spectacular falls into a category with Jah Mali, Steve Machete and long gone Xterminator chanter (Roaring) Lion as artists who are genuinely SUPREMELY talented but for some reason can't seem to catch on and STAY on to a track leading to the big big songs of which they are clearly capable (although I must confess that Steve Machete, ever so quietly, is one of my absolute favourite artists). While in the case of the others, it may simply come down to a case of not recording enough or not having the proper promotion, I have no idea why Spectacular has failed to catch on and stay there. His talent is one, which is so subtle and so. . . Spectacular, that it really takes awhile to discover, but without a doubt, he maybe currently the only one with such a skill currently recording reggae music. Traditionally, artists with big, heavy and coarse voices have to almost forego having good melodies in their music in reggae. For example, the best cases would definitely be Capleton and Buju, both of whom are able to make melodic music, but in order to do so literally have to CHANGE their voice. Another example would be the free-flowing Jah Mason whose styles tend to go from night to day and back in the course of one four and half minute song. Spectacular? Nope. Spectacular is an artist who can actually make a full melodic record despite having abig bellowing voice. If you've never heard Spectacular (more on that in a minute), think of a lower pitched version of agitated St. Ann's (BIGGUP St. Annz!) chanter Perfect (himself, also falling into the case of having the big, melodically challenged voice, although he is one that hardly EVER attempts to change it). I first became aware of Spectacular around the same time I first became aware of Martian voiced Mobay singer, Jah Cure, as the two collaborated in the MAMMOTH combination ditty Chant. Having initially heard that song on Jah Cure's Free Jah's Cure album, I was actually quite curious for a release for Spectacular, who promptly took a LONG leave of absence from reggae, only to return and, like many of his peers, almost immediately head for Europe. It would be in Europe that he would strike on with audiences and more pressingly, with producers and labels as well, which would go on to afford him his debut album in 2005 (curiously enough, for the same label, DHF in Germany, which would almost a year to the day later, release Perfect's debut, Giddimani, as well) Find Yourself. While Perfect's much anticipated debut definitely did what it was supposed to and lived up to expectations, the same cannot be said for Find Yourself, which is actually may be one of the albums which I had been most looking forward to in the last decade or so. Find Yourself introduces the international world (and reintroduces him to Jamaica), but doesn't come close at all to showing the chanter in his best light. Ultimately, one is left with the feeling that something was just missing here.  Unlike Giddimani, which was built largely on previous singles voiced for a variety of top reggae production talents internationally, Find Yourself is a largely German based reggae album, done by German based producers, yet it sounds quite familiar as many of the riddims are reworks and borrowings of more familiar pieces. Of the very few highlights on Find Yourself for the young veteran Spectacular (who just recently celebrated his 32nd earth day, happy belated to him), no light shines brighter than that of the opener, the ultra unique 50 Push Ups. If you are AT ALL a fan of reggae music undoubtedly you've heard songs speaking of the physically strong nature of an artist and almost ALWAYS such a song will turn inevitably to a sexual vibes. 50 Push Ups is a ditty which doesn't go that way at all, instead, it speaks ONLY from a physically healthy point. Its very interestingly and quite possibly the first roots ditty I've ever heard that not only speaks about being HEALTHY, but explicitly goes the extra distance in saying that one must be PHYSICALLY strong in standing up against oppression and those who fight against righteousness. Built over a fairly uneventful one drop (which has a heavy string backing at times), it still has a pretty melodically high vibes, showing exactly what I meant when I said that Spectacular essentially foregoes  changing his vibes in anyway and still creates melodies despite his heavy voice and 50 Push Ups, as the albums best tunes, is a strong example of this. If only the entire album could stay along the same level. Following the opener is the very familiar sounding decent Voice of the People, which flows over Germaican remake of Sly and Robbie's legendary Night Nurse riddim (which in its redone form was known as the Doctor's Darling riddim, and most notably featured Tanya Stephens` big hit It`s a Pity).Voice of the People is a strong enough effort and a very unsurprising include on Find Yourself and on although it has a very low vibes to it (due largely to the fact that Spectacular's voice is just too big for the very laid back riddim, it almost sounds like he's holding back at times, and completely free-styling at others) lyrically is quite an impressive piece. The song has a message of people and particularly those who are oppressed standing up in defiance of their oppressors, to the utter dismay and ultimate destruction of the oppressors. Then things head downhill and only REALLY make one turn back towards the good for the balance of the thirteen remaining tracks. Completing the opener is the downright odd ditty Loud which features German dancehall singer (Mighty) Tolga. While I definitely have a healthy appreciation for both Spectacular and Tolga as solo artists (Tolga is a big singer, several nice its behind with a nice album as well), the combination just doesn't work. For his part, Tolga gives what he usually does, a higher pitched free-flowing style; but Spectacular, instead of his usual LOUDness goes quite all of a sudden (isn't that a coincidence, on the song named Loud he uses his  quietest voice on the album), with this just annoying growling style! And it all happens on an odd UK dancehall/garage hurried sounding riddim.  The one real other time you get a big vibe from Find Yourself which is better than just average or even good is another combination on the album, the very nice Blind to See. The song features the unusual natural voiced Gambian reggae singer Rebellion the Recaller. The vibe here is a much more natural one which works for both artists and while Spectacular doesn't run his voice to its heights, he doesn't change it much either (its basically a more singing version of his usual chanting sound) and of course, in the process creates a lovely melody throughout. Rebellion adds a very unique dimension to the song as well. The title track is another nice addition here which features full blown Spectacular in his usual fashion, but does so on one of the most simple one drops on the entire album (the Bonx It riddim). It also has a very nice message in that it suggests that the only REAL way to Find Yourself is to Find His Imperial Majesty (definitely) and should you fail to do so, you may Find Yourself in situations with which you aren't exactly prepared to deal. Stormy Weather is a similarly vibed track but it is almost COMPLETELY average and greatly UN-spectacular over the weird one-drop Black Survivors riddim (which sounds like the reggae version of a theme music from some spy television show from the 1970's or something of the sorts). And then there's Evil Retire, another VERY SLIGHTLY above average ditty which almost has a freestyle vibes to it in my opinion and really doesn't give too much outside of the norm (I do like the riddim which has just about as SUBTLE horn usage as I've ever heard).  I do want to point out that, of course, lyrically Spectacular does his job. He never steps too far outside of the realm of roots reggae music and he pushes the ideology and concerns that we've come to expect from the genre and lifestyle. Its combining and translating those thoughts to music which is seemingly lost on the remaining tracks of Find Yourself. For prime example, check the unfortunately OVERLY familiar For So Long, which has the miserable `luck' of being voiced over the Campo riddim from Minor 7 Flat 5 records which I have LOOOOOOOONG tired of hearing completely. And the ditty's message is very strong of maintaining oneself and one's mental strength in the face of those who fight against righteousness and even in keeping the knowledge that the song is over three years old (yet not part of the initial batch of Campo riddim recordings), I'm still unable to make it sound good in my ears, just AVERAGE. Speaking of average, check the closer, Gangsta with German Hip Hop group, The Specializtz. The song actually came as a welcome addition after going down the harsh mediocrity which IMMEDIATELY proceeds it (including two very similar sounding dancehall tracks, Family and Move), but doesn't exactly stand too wel on its own merits.  Overall, just as I mentioned, I was quite looking forward to hearing this album for awhile and it certainly doesn't come anywhere near living up to what I had hoped. Since this album was released and on more current terms, Spectacular has seemingly returned to the form he once exhibited prior to Find Yourself. In 2007 he (coincidentally) recorded the very solid Wrong Uniform combination with Steve Machete over the Heavy Duty riddim, also High Grade, an even stronger combination with Lutan Fyah for Irie Ites' Stop Dat Trrain riddim and enjoyed a generally very fine form throughout the year (also check the very nice Good In Myself over the Ghana riddim as well) all of which top 90% of the Find Yourself album. His 2007 was following another strong year in 2006 which saw him doing very nice combinations, highlighted by his combination with Turbulence, High Grade (again) for Mafia & Fluxy's Rocking Time riddim; showing himself to be WELL above what he pushed on his debut album. I hesitate actually recommending the album for anyone in particular, but MAYBE just very new fans to roots reggae, particularly those coming from a background in Hip Hop, MIGHT be able to enjoy this one. Otherwise, join me in waiting for the next piece coming from Spectacular which certainly (even if its just a collection of former singles) be better and much more Spectacular than Find Yourself.\",\n",

Following the opener is the very familiar sounding decent Voice of the People, which flows over Germaican remake of Sly and Robbie's legendary Night Nurse riddim (which in its redone form was known as the Doctor's Darling riddim, and most notably featured Tanya Stephens` big hit It`s a Pity).Voice of the People is a strong enough effort and a very unsurprising include on Find Yourself and on although it has a very low vibes to it (due largely to the fact that Spectacular's voice is just too big for the very laid back riddim, it almost sounds like he's holding back at times, and completely free-styling at others) lyrically is quite an impressive piece. The song has a message of people and particularly those who are oppressed standing up in defiance of their oppressors, to the utter dismay and ultimate destruction of the oppressors. Then things head downhill and only REALLY make one turn back towards the good for the balance of the thirteen remaining tracks. Completing the opener is the downright odd tune Loud which features German dancehall singer (Mighty) Tolga. While I definitely have a healthy appreciation for both Spectacular and Tolga as solo artists (Tolga is a big singer, several nice its behind with a nice album as well), the combination just doesn't work. For his part, Tolga gives what he usually does, a higher pitched free-flowing style; but Spectacular, instead of his usual LOUDness goes quite all of a sudden (isn't that a coincidence, on the song named Loud he uses his  quietest voice on the album), with this just annoying growling style! And it all happens on an odd UK dancehall/garage hurried sounding riddim.  The one real other time you get a big vibe from Find Yourself which is better than just average or even good is another combination on the album, the very nice Blind to See. The song features the unusual natural voiced Gambian reggae singer Rebellion the Recaller. The vibe here is a much more natural one which works for both artists and while Spectacular doesn't run his voice to its heights, he doesn't change it much either (its basically a more singing version of his usual chanting sound) and of course, in the process creates a lovely song throughout. Rebellion adds a very unique dimension to the song as well. The title track is another nice addition here which features full blown Spectacular in his usual fashion, but does so on one of the most simple one drops on the entire album (the Bonx It riddim). It also has a very nice message in that it suggests that the only REAL way to Find Yourself is to Find His Imperial Majesty (definitely) and should you fail to do so, you may Find Yourself in situations with which you aren't exactly prepared to deal. Stormy Weather is a similarly vibed track but it is almost COMPLETELY average and greatly UN-spectacular over the weird one-drop Black Survivors riddim (which sounds like the reggae version of a theme music from some spy television show from the 1970's or something of the sorts). And then there's Evil Retire, another VERY SLIGHTLY above average tune which almost has a freestyle vibes to it in my opinion and really doesn't give too much outside of the norm (I do like the riddim which has just about as SUBTLE horn usage as I've ever heard).  I do want to point out that, of course, lyrically Spectacular does his job. He never steps too far outside of the realm of roots reggae music and he pushes the ideology and concerns that we've come to expect from the genre and lifestyle. Its combining and translating those thoughts to music which is seemingly lost on the remaining tracks of Find Yourself. For prime example, check the unfortunately OVERLY familiar For So Long, which has the miserable `luck' of being voiced over the Campo riddim from Minor 7 Flat 5 records which I have LOOOOOOOONG tired of hearing completely. And the tune's message is very strong of maintaining oneself and one's mental strength in the face of those who fight against righteousness and even in keeping the knowledge that the song is over three years old (yet not part of the initial batch of Campo riddim recordings), I'm still unable to make it sound good in my ears, just AVERAGE. Speaking of average, check the closer, Gangsta with German Hip Hop group, The Specializtz. The song actually came as a welcome addition after going down the harsh mediocrity which IMMEDIATELY proceeds it (including two very similar sounding dancehall tracks, Family and Move), but doesn't exactly stand too wel on its own merits.  Overall, just as I mentioned, I was quite looking forward to hearing this album for awhile and it certainly doesn't come anywhere near living up to what I had hoped. Since this album was released and on more current terms, Spectacular has seemingly returned to the form he once exhibited prior to Find Yourself. In 2007 he (coincidentally) recorded the very solid Wrong Uniform combination with Steve Machete over the Heavy Duty riddim, also High Grade, an even stronger combination with Lutan Fyah for Irie Ites' Stop Dat Trrain riddim and enjoyed a generally very fine form throughout the year (also check the very nice Good In Myself over the Ghana riddim as well) all of which top 90% of the Find Yourself album. His 2007 was following another strong year in 2006 which saw him doing very nice combinations, highlighted by his combination with Turbulence, High Grade (again) for Mafia & Fluxy's Rocking Time riddim; showing himself to be WELL above what he pushed on his debut album. I hesitate actually recommending the album for anyone in particular, but MAYBE just very new fans to roots reggae, particularly those coming from a background in Hip Hop, MIGHT be able to enjoy this one. Otherwise, join me in waiting for the next piece coming from Spectacular which certainly (even if its just a collection of former singles) be better and much more Spectacular than Find Yourself.\",\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Unlike most of the 1-star reviewers, my issue with this album was not primarily with the music, but rather with the lyrics. I\\'ve always said that I don\\'t think NEEDTOBREATHE could possibly write a track with music that I couldn\\'t enjoy -- just because I love Bear\\'s voice so much and can get into just about anything that he sings. And that remained true throughout this album. Each track sounds fantastic. Perhaps the only one that\\'s close to mediocre is \"WHEN I SING.\" Couldn\\'t fully get into the melody of that one. But everything else was amazing, musically.  However. The lyrics at times blew me away with how little good judgment was used in writing them. I was left saying to myself, \"What happened?\" I bought this CD in time for a road trip with some fellow NEEDTOBREATHE-loving friends of mine, so that we could listen and critique as we drove. And in the end, we all unanimously agreed that this album was a very big disappointment, lyrically. Nearly every track had some serious issues.  I have to say first, however, that there were some songs that I very much appreciated. Hence the 2-star rating, rather than 1-star. The lead singles \"HARD LOVE\" and \"MONEY & FAME\" are excellent in every way. Very true to NEEDTOBREATHE\\'s form and very poignant. The former is an anthem about remaining committed in a relationship even through hard times -- that, in fact, the hard times are what strengthen a relationship; thus, we ought to embrace them. The latter track is also very powerful, driving home the point that an unmitigated pursuit of money and fame will corrupt and ultimately bring shame to the pursuer. \"I\\'ve seen the devil in the bright lights\" is a very honest line that not many Christian artists are willing to admit. I have to think that most, if not all, artists -- Christian and secular -- have had to struggle against the desire to give in to the temptations of pride and other sins when they find themselves in the spotlight. I was very pleased to see the Rinehart brothers acknowledging that on this track.  One other track that stuck out to me was \"BE HERE LONG,\" a very touching, thought-provoking love track about cherishing a relationship as much as possible, because \"we don\\'t get to be here long.\" The music perfectly complemented the theme, and I found it a very profound bright spot in the album. Unfortunately, it was the only love track (besides \"HARD LOVE\") of which I could find myself approving.  Nearly the entire remainder of the album is full of lyrical problems. I will list some of the highlights that come immediately to my mind:  \"WHEN I SING,\" while not entirely problematic, features one line (\"Your skin feels just like a rose petal\") that I just don\\'t feel comfortable with, coming from Christians, as well as several lines that seem to idolize a lover.  \"GREAT NIGHT,\" while it initially struck me as merely a fun anthem, enters questionable territory when it talks about \"breaking rules,\" \"wasting time\" and being \"outlaws\" in order to \"feel alive.\" Perhaps it\\'s all based on a metaphor that I\\'m not quite understanding, but I\\'ve tried and I can\\'t quite figure it out.  \"DON\\'T BRING THAT TROUBLE\" features the singer dealing with an unhealthy relationship in problematic ways. Instead of trying to reach reconciliation through honestly working through problems, he wants them to just be swept under the rug and ignored. He doesn\\'t want to be hindered on his journey (\"don\\'t hold me back\"), so he just wants the person to shut up, essentially. This comes off as very selfish to me. He wants the relationship to continue (and, to me, it sounds like a relationship with a relative of some kind, perhaps a parent), but he doesn\\'t want to be challenged or confronted. He just wants the relative/relation to support him -- whether explicitly by encouraging him or implicitly by shutting up about their objections. This is a very unhealthy, selfish way to resolve problems, and it was very bothersome to me.  \"LET\\'S STAY HOME TONIGHT,\" at its core, is a beautiful love track from a husband to his wife. And its music beautifully complements it. However, I honestly don\\'t believe it\\'s something that a Christian man should be publishing for anyone other than his wife to hear. It enters into very suggestive territory at times (\"we can build a fire\"; \"don\\'t even have to put clothes on\"; \"slow down, see where it can take us\"), and I just don\\'t believe it can be beneficial for the listener.  \"HAPPINESS\" is actually one of the most problematic songs on the album for me. Which is ironic, since it was the first major single released to Christian radio, and it\\'s doing fairly well there. Before purchasing the album, I had never really listened to lyrics in the track much. I knew it was about the pursuit of happiness, and I assumed that the rest of the lyrics in the track elaborated upon why that is a worthy Christian pursuit. But that doesn\\'t seem to be what the track is about at all. It is a fairly selfish track, masked by the seemingly uplifting chorus. The singer talks throughout the track about how he has these dreams and ideas of what he wants his future to look like, and he\\'s giving everything he has to pursue those dreams, because he believes they will bring him happiness. He knows he wasn\\'t made for the simple life, so he just has to pursue these things that will make him (and potentially others, through him) happy. But why is he writing this track? It sounds like a track that is meant to justify the lengths to which he is going in order to pursue his happiness. He repeatedly says \"it\\'s all for you\" -- presumably his wife/family. It seems to be a track written to his family to explain why he is spending so much time in pursuit of his own dreams, imploring them to support him, despite the time that he has to spend away from them. To me, it feels like a very schizophrenic track: he says it\\'s all \"in my pursuit of happiness,\" which makes it sound like this is a selfish pursuit... and yet in the middle of that very line he inserts \"for you.\" So somehow, despite the fact that he\\'s pursuing his own happiness, it\\'s ultimately going to end in their happiness as well, presumably because furthering his dreams will help to provide for his family. But is that really how a husband and father should be living his life (or anyone else, for that matter)? This is Pragmatism 101: the ends justify the means. If I\\'m going to make you and myself happy in the end, then I will do whatever it takes to get to that point -- even if it means that there will be nights when you feel alone and you\\'re not happy, or weeks on end where I\\'m away from home, on tour, pursuing my dreams. I cannot wrap my head around how this mindset could possibly fit with the calling of a Christian.  \"CLEAR\" is another track that poses some serious problems. I am all about a husband loving his wife, cherishing her more than any other earthly possession, pursuing her happiness and well-being. I don\\'t think enough husbands are that committed to their wives. But one thing that is not helpful at all, and also very unhealthy for a woman, is when her lover idolizes her and puts her above even his pursuit of and love for God. And that\\'s what seems to take place in this track. Everything seems to point to this woman (he calls her \"honey\" multiple times, so there\\'s no room for arguing that this is a love track to Jesus) being the singer\\'s sole motivation and pursuit in life. She gets all of his love and all of his attention, and the only thing he wants to do is be with her. Even up to that point in the track, it could be justified as a track about fidelity in marriage, which is a very honorable thing. But near the end of the track, there\\'s no getting away from the idolatry that\\'s present. The singer describes that time with his wife makes him feel like heaven has come down and is right here with him. He alludes to a line from \"Amazing Grace\" that was originally a description of one\\'s relationship with God to say that he once was lost, but now is found... when he\\'s with his wife. Under what circumstances is that going to be helpful for a wife, to treat her as if she\\'s the most important being in the universe? A Christian man should be pursuing Christ above all else, and when his wife joins him in that pursuit, they will grow closer and closer to one another as they move towards the same Goal. But the pursuit of a spouse above all else can only lead to pride and self-exaltation. It\\'s not pointing her to Jesus; it\\'s pointing her to herself as the fulfillment of all desires and the satisfaction of all needs. This is worlds away from the type of love track a Christian man ought to be singing to his wife.  And what makes me so confused about this is the fact that, at other points in this album, there seems to be some tension in the singer\\'s marriage relationship, which would mean that his wife isn\\'t even worthy of the extreme devotion and worship he ascribes to her. \"NO EXCUSES\" seems to pretty clearly detail the fact that the singer\\'s wife is not being very faithful in their relationship. The track rightly responds that there is no excuse for such behavior and that it needs to stop, in the name of fidelity and keeping the marriage strong. But then by the end of the record, it\\'s as if the wife has never done anything wrong and deserves the highest form of devotion in the world. It just doesn\\'t make sense to me. Especially if the wife is also the object of criticism in the track \"HAPPINESS.\"  The one track that had an almost certainly Christian message was \"TESTIFY,\" and even that one fell short. It didn\\'t explicitly mention \"God\" or \"Jesus,\" and while Christians would definitely recognize the track as a religious track about coming to the fountain to be satisfied, it\\'s a perfect fit for a mainstream album, because only Christians are going to pick up on that. If one doesn\\'t have the \"inside knowledge\" about the significance of a \"fountain\" for Christianity, they\\'re not going to know it\\'s a Christian track. For that reason, I was more bothered by this track than benefited by it. Not necessarily because of the track itself but because of the way it was executed. It was clearly written in such a way that it could fit right in on a mainstream record.  Ultimately, this album is just one big batch of confusion. Conflicting messages abound, and a Christian worldview is almost entirely absent. It\\'s as if any Christian foundation has been done away with in this album. I would definitely not recommend the CD to anyone as \"Christian.\" Is it a musically pleasing album? Yes. In that sense, it is very artistic, whole, and satisfying. But as an offering from individuals who claim to be Christians, whose primary pursuit in life is Christ and His glory, it is extremely inconsistent and confusing.  Some might be bothered by the standards to which I\\'m holding the members of the band. I keep appealing to the fact that they\\'re \"Christians\" and that they should or shouldn\\'t be acting a certain way. I understand that this language sounds judgmental and harsh, especially since NEEDTOBREATHE has never really explicitly claimed to be a \"Christian band,\" nor have they ever attempted to only reach a Christian audience. Quite to the contrary, actually. But that doesn\\'t change the fact that the Rineharts were raised by a pastor, and they have never given any implication that they\\'ve forsaken their Christian roots. And they constantly attempt to reach out to the Christian market, playing Christian festivals and releasing songs to Christian radio. So I still hold them to a Christian standard, since the apostle Paul tells us that it\\'s those who claim to be part of the Church whom we are to judge. Not to be harsh or mean-spirited, but to promote the integrity and purity of the body of Christ. If someone claims to be of Christ\\'s body, but their lifestyle, actions, or pursuits don\\'t line up, that ought to be pointed out, in order that the Name of Christ might not be profaned.  I have immensely enjoyed NEEDTOBREATHE\\'s output in the past. Sure, most of their music has not been explicitly Christian. And I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard them mention the name of Jesus. But neither were their lyrics ever especially problematic or at odds with a Christian worldview. In other words, I\\'ve never had the thought that a Christian could not (or at least would not) write the lyrics that they write, with a clean conscience. But after hearing this album, that\\'s no longer the case. And it saddens me. I bought the CD, so there\\'s nothing I can do about it now. I wish I had previewed it on Spotify and saved myself the money. But at least my friends now know that it\\'s not worth their money. Hopefully this review can help others reach that conclusion as well.',\n",

Unfortunately, it was the only love song (besides \"HARD LOVE\") of which I could find myself approving.  Nearly the entire remainder of the album is full of lyrical problems. I will list some of the highlights that come immediately to my mind:  \"WHEN I SING,\" while not entirely problematic, features one line (\"Your skin feels just like a rose petal\") that I just don\\'t feel comfortable with, coming from Christians, as well as several lines that seem to idolize a lover.  \"GREAT NIGHT,\" while it initially struck me as merely a fun anthem, enters questionable territory when it talks about \"breaking rules,\" \"wasting time\" and being \"outlaws\" in order to \"feel alive.\" Perhaps it\\'s all based on a metaphor that I\\'m not quite understanding, but I\\'ve tried and I can\\'t quite figure it out.  \"DON\\'T BRING THAT TROUBLE\" features the singer dealing with an unhealthy relationship in problematic ways. Instead of trying to reach reconciliation through honestly working through problems, he wants them to just be swept under the rug and ignored. He doesn\\'t want to be hindered on his journey (\"don\\'t hold me back\"), so he just wants the person to shut up, essentially. This comes off as very selfish to me. He wants the relationship to continue (and, to me, it sounds like a relationship with a relative of some kind, perhaps a parent), but he doesn\\'t want to be challenged or confronted. He just wants the relative/relation to support him -- whether explicitly by encouraging him or implicitly by shutting up about their objections. This is a very unhealthy, selfish way to resolve problems, and it was very bothersome to me.  \"LET\\'S STAY HOME TONIGHT,\" at its core, is a beautiful love song from a husband to his wife. And its music beautifully complements it. However, I honestly don\\'t believe it\\'s something that a Christian man should be publishing for anyone other than his wife to hear. It enters into very suggestive territory at times (\"we can build a fire\"; \"don\\'t even have to put clothes on\"; \"slow down, see where it can take us\"), and I just don\\'t believe it can be beneficial for the listener.  \"HAPPINESS\" is actually one of the most problematic songs on the album for me. Which is ironic, since it was the first major single released to Christian radio, and it\\'s doing fairly well there. Before purchasing the album, I had never really listened to lyrics in the song much. I knew it was about the pursuit of happiness, and I assumed that the rest of the lyrics in the song elaborated upon why that is a worthy Christian pursuit. But that doesn\\'t seem to be what the song is about at all. It is a fairly selfish song, masked by the seemingly uplifting chorus. The singer talks throughout the song about how he has these dreams and ideas of what he wants his future to look like, and he\\'s giving everything he has to pursue those dreams, because he believes they will bring him happiness. He knows he wasn\\'t made for the simple life, so he just has to pursue these things that will make him (and potentially others, through him) happy. But why is he writing this song? It sounds like a song that is meant to justify the lengths to which he is going in order to pursue his happiness. He repeatedly says \"it\\'s all for you\" -- presumably his wife/family. It seems to be a song written to his family to explain why he is spending so much time in pursuit of his own dreams, imploring them to support him, despite the time that he has to spend away from them. To me, it feels like a very schizophrenic song: he says it\\'s all \"in my pursuit of happiness,\" which makes it sound like this is a selfish pursuit... and yet in the middle of that very line he inserts \"for you.\" So somehow, despite the fact that he\\'s pursuing his own happiness, it\\'s ultimately going to end in their happiness as well, presumably because furthering his dreams will help to provide for his family. But is that really how a husband and father should be living his life (or anyone else, for that matter)? This is Pragmatism 101: the ends justify the means. If I\\'m going to make you and myself happy in the end, then I will do whatever it takes to get to that point -- even if it means that there will be nights when you feel alone and you\\'re not happy, or weeks on end where I\\'m away from home, on tour, pursuing my dreams. I cannot wrap my head around how this mindset could possibly fit with the calling of a Christian.  \"CLEAR\" is another song that poses some serious problems. I am all about a husband loving his wife, cherishing her more than any other earthly possession, pursuing her happiness and well-being. I don\\'t think enough husbands are that committed to their wives. But one thing that is not helpful at all, and also very unhealthy for a woman, is when her lover idolizes her and puts her above even his pursuit of and love for God. And that\\'s what seems to take place in this song. Everything seems to point to this woman (he calls her \"honey\" multiple times, so there\\'s no room for arguing that this is a love song to Jesus) being the singer\\'s sole motivation and pursuit in life. She gets all of his love and all of his attention, and the only thing he wants to do is be with her. Even up to that point in the song, it could be justified as a song about fidelity in marriage, which is a very honorable thing. But near the end of the song, there\\'s no getting away from the idolatry that\\'s present. The singer describes that time with his wife makes him feel like heaven has come down and is right here with him. He alludes to a line from \"Amazing Grace\" that was originally a description of one\\'s relationship with God to say that he once was lost, but now is found... when he\\'s with his wife. Under what circumstances is that going to be helpful for a wife, to treat her as if she\\'s the most important being in the universe? A Christian man should be pursuing Christ above all else, and when his wife joins him in that pursuit, they will grow closer and closer to one another as they move towards the same Goal. But the pursuit of a spouse above all else can only lead to pride and self-exaltation. It\\'s not pointing her to Jesus; it\\'s pointing her to herself as the fulfillment of all desires and the satisfaction of all needs. This is worlds away from the type of love song a Christian man ought to be singing to his wife.  And what makes me so confused about this is the fact that, at other points in this album, there seems to be some tension in the singer\\'s marriage relationship, which would mean that his wife isn\\'t even worthy of the extreme devotion and worship he ascribes to her. \"NO EXCUSES\" seems to pretty clearly detail the fact that the singer\\'s wife is not being very faithful in their relationship. The song rightly responds that there is no excuse for such behavior and that it needs to stop, in the name of fidelity and keeping the marriage strong. But then by the end of the record, it\\'s as if the wife has never done anything wrong and deserves the highest form of devotion in the world. It just doesn\\'t make sense to me. Especially if the wife is also the object of criticism in the song \"HAPPINESS.\"  The one song that had an almost certainly Christian message was \"TESTIFY,\" and even that one fell short. It didn\\'t explicitly mention \"God\" or \"Jesus,\" and while Christians would definitely recognize the song as a religious song about coming to the fountain to be satisfied, it\\'s a perfect fit for a mainstream album, because only Christians are going to pick up on that. If one doesn\\'t have the \"inside knowledge\" about the significance of a \"fountain\" for Christianity, they\\'re not going to know it\\'s a Christian song. For that reason, I was more bothered by this song than benefited by it. Not necessarily because of the song itself but because of the way it was executed. It was clearly written in such a way that it could fit right in on a mainstream record.  Ultimately, this album is just one big batch of confusion. Conflicting messages abound, and a Christian worldview is almost entirely absent. It\\'s as if any Christian foundation has been done away with in this album. I would definitely not recommend the CD to anyone as \"Christian.\" Is it a musically pleasing album? Yes. In that sense, it is very artistic, whole, and satisfying. But as an offering from individuals who claim to be Christians, whose primary pursuit in life is Christ and His glory, it is extremely inconsistent and confusing.  Some might be bothered by the standards to which I\\'m holding the members of the band. I keep appealing to the fact that they\\'re \"Christians\" and that they should or shouldn\\'t be acting a certain way. I understand that this language sounds judgmental and harsh, especially since NEEDTOBREATHE has never really explicitly claimed to be a \"Christian band,\" nor have they ever attempted to only reach a Christian audience. Quite to the contrary, actually. But that doesn\\'t change the fact that the Rineharts were raised by a pastor, and they have never given any implication that they\\'ve forsaken their Christian roots. And they constantly attempt to reach out to the Christian market, playing Christian festivals and releasing songs to Christian radio. So I still hold them to a Christian standard, since the apostle Paul tells us that it\\'s those who claim to be part of the Church whom we are to judge. Not to be harsh or mean-spirited, but to promote the integrity and purity of the body of Christ. If someone claims to be of Christ\\'s body, but their lifestyle, actions, or pursuits don\\'t line up, that ought to be pointed out, in order that the Name of Christ might not be profaned.  I have immensely enjoyed NEEDTOBREATHE\\'s output in the past. Sure, most of their music has not been explicitly Christian. And I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard them mention the name of Jesus. But neither were their lyrics ever especially problematic or at odds with a Christian worldview. In other words, I\\'ve never had the thought that a Christian could not (or at least would not) write the lyrics that they write, with a clean conscience. But after hearing this album, that\\'s no longer the case. And it saddens me. I bought the CD, so there\\'s nothing I can do about it now. I wish I had previewed it on Spotify and saved myself the money. But at least my friends now know that it\\'s not worth their money. Hopefully this review can help others reach that conclusion as well.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'My first encounter with Black Veil Brides was probably the same as most people\\'s, a viewing of their hit video, \\'Knives and Pens.\\' I watched it twice, unable to believe just how perfectly this band fit into the popular \\'post-hardcore\\' (a.k.a., \\'emo\\') clique/genre. It was even difficult to believe the band actually took themselves seriously and were not just a parody of post-hardcore bands. The video has all the trademarks of the movement; when the lead singer, Andy Sixx is first seen, he is dressed in skinny jeans, a V-neck shirt, and sports the typical scene-do: teased, with way too much hairspray. He looks up, showing off his eyeliner and very silly-looking \\'zombie\\' mouth makeup,and grins \\'manically\\' in what he apparently hopes will be a disturbing or frightening way at the camera.

A few shots later, Sixx employs the use of another popular screamo move, the \\'swing the microphone cord around your head like a lasso.\\' Yee-haw! Then he skips forward like a little girl before leaning in towards the camera to do the \\'evil\\' grin a second time. (\"See my make-up? Ya see it? Real hard-core, huh?\") Next, the band establishes up front what kind of kids they\\'re seeking to corrupt and get big off of through their self-pitying music by showing a little emo boy, maybe in 6th grade, dressed in skinnies, black converse, and a bandanna,  being picked on at school. The first word that Sixx sings? \"Alone.\" The song goes on for just long enough to touch on all the trademarks of screamo/emo music. Annoying, tired guitar riffs, angsty, childish lyrics, not-so-inspired screams, and of course...right when you feel it coming, the stereo-typical one chord breakdown, spiced up with a squeal here and there. Oh, and the kid gets bullied some more. But don\\'t despair, Black Veil Brides want to help!   After the instant success of this video, it wasn\\'t too long before some very crafty marketers and Black Veil Brides got together to conquer every Hot Topic from West coast to East coast and the band started recording. The result? The \\'highly anticipated\\' debut album, \\'We Stitch These Wounds.\\' Before reviewing the music, perhaps we should see what Black Veil Bride\\'s have to say for themselves. To do this, I\\'ll go to BVB\\'s favorite hang-out, Myspace. In their biography, they declare themselves a \\'dark rock sensation.\\' (Dark rock...? Jeez, I just thought it was teenybopper music for that certain group of middle schoolers that want to be different...silly me.) Later they brag of their Hot Topic shelf space, forgetting that they share said shelf space with the likes of Justin Bieber, the Jonas Brothers, and Lady GaGa. (Somehow I have an inkling that there\\'s a negative correlation between the amount of T shirts sold at Hot Topic and the quality of the artist\\'s music.) In the following sentence, Black Veil Brides burden us with the disturbing information that their fans refer to themselves as Bridesmaids, a nickname that apparently the band encourages. So...we have a group of guys calling themselves \\'brides\\',(in other words, declaring that they are women), and we have their fans calling themselves Bridesmaids? (According to Wikipedia, a bridesmaid is \"...typically a young woman.\") And yet young emo boys think that they are hardcore for being a fan of this band... Lastly, Black Veil Brides \\'mention\\' that they ranked 9th in Myspace\\'s  Top Music Charts...in the Metal category. This is thrown out seemingly nonchalantly, but it is painfully obvious to the more astute reader that BVB\\'s is actually attempting to convince you that they are real metal, not emo pop. After all, Myspace said so! In case this is not enough, the photos of the band on their Myspace page should be enough to convince most reasonably mature, intelligent people that the band is made up of Alice Cooper-wannabe posers. All band members are dressed in the usual scene style with ridiculously teased hair, but go to the added measure of caking themselves in unoriginal white and black makeup. Apparently too lazy to come up with something original, or perhaps just fully aware that their fans wouldn\\'t be able to tell rip offs from the real thing, they shamelessly copy Alice Cooper\\'s and Kiss\\'s old makeup designs from the 70\\'s. In case this still isn\\'t enough, the band also resorts to overused, dumb poses for their photo shoots. Andy Sixx looks skyward with puppy dog eyes, hands together as if in prayer. Ashley Purdy raises his hand up in not one, but two pictures in an effort to be absolutely sure that his new fingerless gloves are seen by all.   Furthermore, the band also insists that they have \\'over the top theatrics.\\' (Yeah, that\\'s really cool, BVB. I realize that you wish you were Alice Cooper, but you are not, Andy Sixx, and won\\'t ever be, no matter how much eyeliner you wear).    Now, onto the music of their debut. The album kicks off with \\'The Outcasts (Call to Arms)\\'. Yes, you heard correctly. This band even has a \\'call to arms\\' like so many other bands of the same genre. \"This record is for the Outcasts. Following our stories of Love, Life, And Never Giving In\" introduces a voice. Really? Are you kidding me? Yes, the band, desperate to fit into the annoying clique of emo screamo, even openly states that their music is strictly for the elite, the \\'outcasts.\\' But they also have that usual ounce of hope--\"never giving in.\" That\\'s so inspiring, Andy Sixx. Track two is \\'We Stitch These Wounds.\\' \"You kissed the lips of evil..\" sings Sixx in the first line. Now, what that\\'s supposed to mean, I don\\'t know, but it\\'s a line laced with popular emo words (kissed, lips, evil), so it works. The chorus is made up of more screams from Andy about how \"You\\'re by yourself!\" \\'Beautiful Remains\\' falls back on that unbelievably cliche plot, fully exhausted by 2004 but still used by countless bands yearly, of the guy\\'s girlfriend dying. She dies, he sets her on fire, because fire is cool and daredevil, after all, and he gets a little emotional because \"All we\\'ve fought for now is dead.\" Essentially, a break up song for the emo kids. \\'Children Surrender\\' does nothing that hasn\\'t already been done before in the previous tracks, except boast lyrics that make even less sense. Example: \"An exorcise of life to anthem beneath our hands, Like souls who missed their plight, we\\'ll bleed along the sand.\" So how do you anthem an exorcise of life, I wonder? And how is that \\'like souls who missed their plight\\', a.k.a., a dangerous or difficult situation? The rather pointless use of the word \\'sand\\' also makes it clear that it was used solely to rhyme with \\'hands.\\' \\'Perfect Weapon\\' is a standard emo screamo tune, following the promising recipe of a catchy \\'metalcore\\' opening guitar riff, and another irritating, unoriginal \\'breakdown.\\' The lyrics are about an emo boy who stays up at night to make lists of victims, targeting those who have hurt him. In the chorus, Andy lets loose howls of \"YOU\\'RE ON YOUR OWN!\" Yep, more lyrics about being alone. I\\'m sure many immature emo kids find this very easy to relate to, and therefor inspiring,but I find it sickening. We get it, you\\'re on your own. Now find something WORTH singing about. Next is the aforementioned Knives and Pens, another celebration of glorifying being alone and emo, with some knives and pens for company. In the next track, the band decides to provide a break from the monotone screaming and wearisome riffing by changing things up with an acoustic song. Sadly, it is no less awful. In his lame Alice Cooper impersonation, Sixx warbles along for a few minutes with the help of Auto-tune. One can easily imagine the band writing this song; Sixx flipping through his Big Book of Emo Words and picking those that he likes best. \"Hmmm. Funerals. Funerals are for dead people. Dead people are emo. So funeral is good. What else? Oh, this is good...\\'pain.\\' Gotta use that. What else? Hmmm...scream, haunt, bleeding, promised, loved...now, how can I string these words together?\" The result? \\'The Mortician\\'s Daughter\\', a song written for Andy\\'s girlfriend, whose father is, actually, a mortician. (Thanks to whatsherface for the correction.) \\'All Your Hate\\' is basically filler comprising of more emo words. \\'Lonely, holy, deadly, blood red, hate, burn,die, lost....blahblahblah. Doesn\\'t Andy have anything more to write about than this? It comes across as bad teen poetry. Track Nine: \\'Heaven\\'s Calling\\'. So, from the title, we may assume that Andy Sixx is now so caught up in his romantic emo world of darkness,morticians, loneliness, and death, that he is now ready to die. After all, Heaven is calling to him! Directly after he howls this declaration, he comes back in with some \"RAWRS!\" (It\\'s easy to imagine some silly scene girls insisting \"It\\'s dinosaur for \\'I LUV YOU!\") Well, if you ever surrender to heaven\\'s beckons, Mister Sixx, I know at least one person who won\\'t miss you. THIS GUY! The next track exemplifies what BVB earlier insisted their message is, never giving in. The name of the track? Never Give In, of course. In this hopeful composition written to help kids pull through being teased at school for being emo, Sixx sings \"Never give in, never back down.\" This creates an interesting chicken and egg scenario. Kids apparently credit BVB with giving them hope and helping them survive being teased and bullied for being emo, but these same kids only become \\'emo\\' in the first place because of listening to bands such as BVB, who glorify being one and make gullible kids think it\\'s cool to. Sweet Blasphemy: More filler about being strong in sadness. Stereotypical tune. The album finishes with \\'Carolyn.\\' This tune stands out for being the first time BVB declare \\'You\\'re not alone.\\' Huh? But for the last eleven songs all you\\'ve been telling me is that I AM alone...I\\'m confused, Mister Sixx.  Musically, the album achieves nothing but rehashing everything most terrible about emo screamo music. Although the band is admittedly competent technically, writing music is decidedly not their forte. However, if you answer yes to most or any of the following, Black Veil Brides: We Stitch These Wounds may be right for you: 1. Do you delight in dwelling on everything that\\'s wrong with your life? 2. Did your mommy buy you a Medium and not the Large soda that you WANTED at McDonald\\'s? (She must not love you.) 3. Do you insist that all your clothes were bought at Hot Topic? 4. Do you enjoy bands such as Escape the Fate, From First to Last, Attack Attack!, and Asking Alexandria, and feel you relate to their lyrics? 5. Have you ever fantasized about killing your girlfriend so you can be together in death? 6. Is your mouth open with your hands clutching an imaginary heart in your Myspace profile pic? 7. Do you straighten your hair over at least one eye to show you are unique? 8. Do you hate all that is mainstream, and feign an undying love for Hello Kitty, poetry, Elmo, and Dinosawrs, and have lots of other cute \\'obsessions\\'? 9. Do you insist that you are \\'above the influence\\' yet constantly follow the current trend of acting like a  toddler? 10. Do you boast of your nonexistent suicide attempts and cutting sessions, and try desperately to sound h@rdC0r3 by bragging on Facebook of how wasted you are? 11. Are you under the age of 14? 12. Most importantly, are you alone?  If so, spend your money on this CD. BVB will stitch your emotional wounds and you won\\'t be disappointed. However, to the rest of us, it should be clear that BVB\\'s music is marketed specifically for young kids, primarily girls, who can drool to their heart\\'s content over Andy Sixx no matter how awful the music is. Black Veil Brides is just the newest popular trend, one that shouldn\\'t be followed.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'My first encounter with Black Veil Brides was probably the same as most people\\'s, a viewing of their hit video, \\'Knives and Pens.\\' I watched it twice, unable to believe just how perfectly this band fit into the popular \\'post-hardcore\\' (a.k.a., \\'emo\\') clique/genre. It was even difficult to believe the band actually took themselves seriously and were not just a parody of post-hardcore bands. The video has all the trademarks of the movement; when the lead singer, Andy Sixx is first seen, he is dressed in skinny jeans, a V-neck shirt, and sports the typical scene-do: teased, with way too much hairspray. He looks up, showing off his eyeliner and very silly-looking \\'zombie\\' mouth makeup,and grins \\'manically\\' in what he apparently hopes will be a disturbing or frightening way at the camera. (I laughed). For those unfamiliar with screamo/emo music, this is a typical move used by legions of post-hardcore bands. A few shots later, Sixx employs the use of another popular screamo move, the \\'swing the microphone cord around your head like a lasso.\\' Yee-haw! Then he skips forward like a little girl before leaning in towards the camera to do the \\'evil\\' grin a second time. (\"See my make-up? Ya see it? Real hard-core, huh?\") Next, the band establishes up front what kind of kids they\\'re seeking to corrupt and get big off of through their self-pitying music by showing a little emo boy, maybe in 6th grade, dressed in skinnies, black converse, and a bandanna,  being picked on at school. The first word that Sixx sings? \"Alone.\" The song goes on for just long enough to touch on all the trademarks of screamo/emo music. Annoying, tired guitar riffs, angsty, childish lyrics, not-so-inspired screams, and of course...right when you feel it coming, the stereo-typical one chord breakdown, spiced up with a squeal here and there. Oh, and the kid gets bullied some more. But don\\'t despair, Black Veil Brides want to help!   After the instant success of this video, it wasn\\'t too long before some very crafty marketers and Black Veil Brides got together to conquer every Hot Topic from West coast to East coast and the band started recording. The result? The \\'highly anticipated\\' debut cd, \\'We Stitch These Wounds.\\' Before reviewing the music, perhaps we should see what Black Veil Bride\\'s have to say for themselves. To do this, I\\'ll go to BVB\\'s favorite hang-out, Myspace. In their biography, they declare themselves a \\'dark rock sensation.\\' (Dark rock...? Jeez, I just thought it was teenybopper music for that certain group of middle schoolers that want to be different...silly me.) Later they brag of their Hot Topic shelf space, forgetting that they share said shelf space with the likes of Justin Bieber, the Jonas Brothers, and Lady GaGa. (Somehow I have an inkling that there\\'s a negative correlation between the amount of T shirts sold at Hot Topic and the quality of the artist\\'s music.) In the following sentence, Black Veil Brides burden us with the disturbing information that their fans refer to themselves as Bridesmaids, a nickname that apparently the band encourages. So...we have a group of guys calling themselves \\'brides\\',(in other words, declaring that they are women), and we have their fans calling themselves Bridesmaids? (According to Wikipedia, a bridesmaid is \"...typically a young woman.\") And yet young emo boys think that they are hardcore for being a fan of this band... Lastly, Black Veil Brides \\'mention\\' that they ranked 9th in Myspace\\'s  Top Music Charts...in the Metal category. This is thrown out seemingly nonchalantly, but it is painfully obvious to the more astute reader that BVB\\'s is actually attempting to convince you that they are real metal, not emo pop. After all, Myspace said so! In case this is not enough, the photos of the band on their Myspace page should be enough to convince most reasonably mature, intelligent people that the band is made up of Alice Cooper-wannabe posers. All band members are dressed in the usual scene style with ridiculously teased hair, but go to the added measure of caking themselves in unoriginal white and black makeup. Apparently too lazy to come up with something original, or perhaps just fully aware that their fans wouldn\\'t be able to tell rip offs from the real thing, they shamelessly copy Alice Cooper\\'s and Kiss\\'s old makeup designs from the 70\\'s. In case this still isn\\'t enough, the band also resorts to overused, dumb poses for their photo shoots. Andy Sixx looks skyward with puppy dog eyes, hands together as if in prayer. Ashley Purdy raises his hand up in not one, but two pictures in an effort to be absolutely sure that his new fingerless gloves are seen by all.   Furthermore, the band also insists that they have \\'over the top theatrics.\\' (Yeah, that\\'s really cool, BVB. I realize that you wish you were Alice Cooper, but you are not, Andy Sixx, and won\\'t ever be, no matter how much eyeliner you wear).    Now, onto the music of their debut. The cd kicks off with \\'The Outcasts (Call to Arms)\\'. Yes, you heard correctly. This band even has a \\'call to arms\\' like so many other bands of the same genre. \"This record is for the Outcasts. Following our stories of Love, Life, And Never Giving In\" introduces a voice. Really? Are you kidding me? Yes, the band, desperate to fit into the annoying clique of emo screamo, even openly states that their music is strictly for the elite, the \\'outcasts.\\' But they also have that usual ounce of hope--\"never giving in.\" That\\'s so inspiring, Andy Sixx. Track two is \\'We Stitch These Wounds.\\' \"You kissed the lips of evil..\" sings Sixx in the first line. Now, what that\\'s supposed to mean, I don\\'t know, but it\\'s a line laced with popular emo words (kissed, lips, evil), so it works. The chorus is made up of more screams from Andy about how \"You\\'re by yourself!\" \\'Beautiful Remains\\' falls back on that unbelievably cliche plot, fully exhausted by 2004 but still used by countless bands yearly, of the guy\\'s girlfriend dying. She dies, he sets her on fire, because fire is cool and daredevil, after all, and he gets a little emotional because \"All we\\'ve fought for now is dead.\" Essentially, a break up song for the emo kids. \\'Children Surrender\\' does nothing that hasn\\'t already been done before in the previous tracks, except boast lyrics that make even less sense. Example: \"An exorcise of life to cut beneath our hands, Like souls who missed their plight, we\\'ll bleed along the sand.\" So how do you cut an exorcise of life, I wonder? And how is that \\'like souls who missed their plight\\', a.k.a., a dangerous or difficult situation? The rather pointless use of the word \\'sand\\' also makes it clear that it was used solely to rhyme with \\'hands.\\' \\'Perfect Weapon\\' is a standard emo screamo tune, following the promising recipe of a catchy \\'metalcore\\' opening guitar riff, and another irritating, unoriginal \\'breakdown.\\' The lyrics are about an emo boy who stays up at night to make lists of victims, targeting those who have hurt him. In the chorus, Andy lets loose howls of \"YOU\\'RE ON YOUR OWN!\" Yep, more lyrics about being alone. I\\'m sure many immature emo kids find this very easy to relate to, and therefor inspiring,but I find it sickening. We get it, you\\'re on your own. Now find something WORTH singing about. Next is the aforementioned Knives and Pens, another celebration of glorifying being alone and emo, with some knives and pens for company. In the next track, the band decides to provide a break from the monotone screaming and wearisome riffing by changing things up with an acoustic song. Sadly, it is no less awful. In his lame Alice Cooper impersonation, Sixx warbles along for a few minutes with the help of Auto-tune. One can easily imagine the band writing this song; Sixx flipping through his Big Book of Emo Words and picking those that he likes best. \"Hmmm. Funerals. Funerals are for dead people. Dead people are emo. So funeral is good. What else? Oh, this is good...\\'pain.\\' Gotta use that. What else? Hmmm...scream, haunt, bleeding, promised, loved...now, how can I string these words together?\" The result? \\'The Mortician\\'s Daughter\\', a song written for Andy\\'s girlfriend, whose father is, actually, a mortician. (Thanks to whatsherface for the correction.) \\'All Your Hate\\' is basically filler comprising of more emo words. \\'Lonely, holy, deadly, blood red, hate, burn,die, lost....blahblahblah. Doesn\\'t Andy have anything more to write about than this? It comes across as bad teen poetry. Track Nine: \\'Heaven\\'s Calling\\'. So, from the title, we may assume that Andy Sixx is now so caught up in his romantic emo world of darkness,morticians, loneliness, and death, that he is now ready to die. After all, Heaven is calling to him! Directly after he howls this declaration, he comes back in with some \"RAWRS!\" (It\\'s easy to imagine some silly scene girls insisting \"It\\'s dinosaur for \\'I LUV YOU!\") Well, if you ever surrender to heaven\\'s beckons, Mister Sixx, I know at least one person who won\\'t miss you. THIS GUY! The next track exemplifies what BVB earlier insisted their message is, never giving in. The name of the track? Never Give In, of course. In this hopeful composition written to help kids pull through being teased at school for being emo, Sixx sings \"Never give in, never back down.\" This creates an interesting chicken and egg scenario. Kids apparently credit BVB with giving them hope and helping them survive being teased and bullied for being emo, but these same kids only become \\'emo\\' in the first place because of listening to bands such as BVB, who glorify being one and make gullible kids think it\\'s cool to. Sweet Blasphemy: More filler about being strong in sadness. Stereotypical tune. The cd finishes with \\'Carolyn.\\' This tune stands out for being the first time BVB declare \\'You\\'re not alone.\\' Huh?

       " {'reviewText': 'Yet another misfire... This is NOT the best choice for listening to Robert Johnson.  This review is for the Robert Johnson Centennial 2 CD set.  The overall sound quality still misses the mark by a wide margin... Robert often still sounds a bit too much like he is singing in a tunnel without any real bottom end in the sound spectrum.  It did not have to turn out that way - there are better representations of this material out there.  Yes, there is a slight improvement in this Centennial set in terms of clarity over the two previous double CD box sets, but is that really saying very much?  Both of those earlier sets sounded really bad, and neither were worthy then nor now of any sort of bench mark status - it\\'s not difficult to improve on crap!  Unfortunately many misguided and misinformed reviewers in this forum are basing their opinions on \"how much better\" this Centennial set is compared to the 1990 set!  That is setting the bar way too low!  A more realistic bench mark would be the two separate single CD releases of \"The King of the Delta Blues\" (KOTDB, vol. 1 & 2), the first volume of which was released in 1998.  On the KOTDB CDs we got a significant breakthough in sound quality (the first breakthrough was the much earlier gold disc release).  Some of the improvement on the KOTDB CDs was due to superior source material, but a lot of it simply had to do with EQ - you could FINALLY hear ALL of the lower bass registers on the KOTDB CDs - Robert\\'s guitar for the first time was sonically on equal footing with Robert\\'s voice instead of being drowned out in the background - in short, the music on KOTDB gained a very full, complete and satisfying sound spectrum.  He sounded like he was finally out of the tunnel and back in the room with you.  The reviews in Amazon for KOTDB were overwhelmingly positive at the time... even celebratory.  Nobody had any complaints about the KOTDB CDs.  You could now really hear even the room ambiance of the hotel room where these were recorded.  Then along comes this latest Centennial release and the EQ was inexplicitly re-set back to the old dinosaur position of rolling off the bass - back to square one again!  Now you can argue all day long about RIAA curves and the microphones used or even the speed of the recordings - in fact, that sort of technical discussion seems to be all that some people are interested in!  Discussions about whether the source materials included metal masters or 78s or just tapes made in 1961 of long lost sources, etc. abound.  That is all fine and well, but you have to get your facts straight.  For example, even in the liners notes of the Centennial release I note some inconsistencies in terms of the discussion at large of what sources were used for the KOTDB CD.  In the Centennial insert booklet, on pg. 23, Steven LaVere , clearly states that the selections on the KOTDB CD \"...were all newly transferred from original discs...\"  I take this to mean that KOTDB was entirely sourced directly from 78 discs... Seems like a reasonable takeaway, right?  And yet in this very forum another reviewer emphatically insisted that I was \"misinformed\" and that many of the sources for the KOTDB CDs were actually from magnetic tape copies from 1961 transfers as opposed to directly from disc. Really?  Not according to Columbia\\'s own literature as quoted above.  Be careful... there are a lot of so-called experts out there their grinding axes.... Misinformation abounds.  Regardless, for what it\\'s worth, consider a different way of looking at the EQ issue.  I actually play guitar.  I even play guitars similar in size to those that Johnson was known to use.  I have even had the opportunity to actually play a 1930\\'s Kalamazoo - the same model guitar Robert is thought to have played on the 78s.  I can tell you that the Kalamazoo I played had a lot of bass - it was not rolled off at all!  When you palm-dampen the bass runs as Robert often does (think \"Sweet Home Chicago\") you get a surprising amount of low-end thumping bass.  But when I heard the Centennial CD version of \"Ramblin\\' On My Mind\" it sounded anemic - the signature booming sound you normally would expect to hear in up front in the foreground had faded to the background - weak and anemic.  Then I listened again to the KOTDB CD for the same cut... and there it is! - the missing bass is back with much more authority.  It is almost as if there is some sort of revisionist attempt here to change Robert Johnson into something other than what he really was.  I think the recording engineers have forgotten that there was only one microphone in the room that day - one mike to pick up both the vocals and the guitar.  Now if the mike is aimed at the vocals then OF COURSE the guitar is going to suffer in the mix, but that does not mean that the EQ cannot be adjusted to compensate - there is nothing sacred about a less than optimal original feed from the microphone. Now, of course one can argue all day long about what the original microphone picked up that day in the studio and what it did not pick up, etc.  Regardless, in my opinion the guitar I heard in the KOTDB CDs sounded realistic in terms of what you would actually hear in the real world - a lot of resonating bass with a nice \"thunk\" while the Centennial set comes off as anemic. If you are not familiar with how a live guitar sounds in a hotel room you can always watch and listen to the \"Sessions for Robert J.\" DVD where Eric Clapton actually plays Robert Johnson songs in the SAME hotel room where many of the Robert Johnson recordings were actually recorded back in the 1930s.  He also does several solo Robert Johnson songs in a Santa Monica hotel room.  Does Eric\\'s guitar sound at all bass-shy in any of these settings?  I don\\'t think so...  EQ is something the sound engineer has to make a decision about... and it is not only about reproducing the limitations of the microphone used, you can improve on bad conditions and compensate for faulty EQ - that\\'s their job.  In my opinion, the right decision was made for the KOTDB CDs and the wrong decision was made for the Centennial set.  You may have a different opinion, but do yourself a favor and compare the two sets side by side and listen for yourself.... forget about all the discussions about RIAA curves and microphones and see which one actually SOUNDS better.  To me KOTDB wins hands down with a superior sound spectrum.  The Centennial set loses...  So, in summary, I will readily concede that the Centennial set managed to reduce the distortion in Robert\\'s voice and that the overall sound is \"cleaner\".  But, unfortunately, that slight improvement is almost completely negated by a lackluster EQ - i.e. there is hardly any mid-bass evident on this Centennial re-mastering - bass that is free for the asking on the KOTDB CDs.  Of course, any time you eliminate the bass to this extent the vocals can also SEEM to gain sharpness and clarity, but not really... it\\'s just that the EQ brings the vocals up front by default.  You are still missing a lot of the music from the bottom end.  And, yes, I will also grant you that Columbia certainly did take out pops and crackles on this latest Centennial set - but, so what? Who really cares? There never was a lot of ticks and pops on these recordings to begin with.  Apparently four metal masters were used for the first time on CD for the Centennial set... which is great; but even the older CDs that were not direct transferred from first generation metal masters (KOTDB CDs for instance) already sounded pretty good in terms of hiss and pops - the problem was always more about distortion and EQ, not pops and ticks. Besides, if you listen to the very first cut on this Centennial set there still is a lot of hiss that was left in. No big deal one way or the other.  Back to the bass or lack of it... even if you do attempt to compensate on the Centennial set by turning the bass knob all the way up to \"12\" you STILL are missing too much bass - it is STILL not anywhere near the bass levels on the unadjusted KOTDB CDs - that is how far off the mark the EQ on the Centennial set is!  Even fully cranking up the bass does not get this turkey up to where it should be.  Wow!  This is why I gave this set a one star.  It is also worth considering that this is the fifth time or even sixth time(!) Columbia has released a \"new and improved\" Robert Johnson collection.  In addition to this latest Centennial set there were two previous attempts at a \"complete\" two disc set - both of which were dismal failures, a gold disc that sounded great at the time and the two KOTDB CDs which seem today to be the only real breakthroughs so far in terms of the overall sound. Unfortunately this Centennial set has taken one step forward (lower distortion) and two steps back (crappy EQ - no bass).  As a side note, here is a curious situation - the most recent Yazoo re-remaster reissues  of Charlie Patton (2010) sound perhaps even fresher and more three dimensional to my ears than this Centennial Robert Johnson set... and yet the source material for those Charlie Patton Yazoos are from really bad vinyl (some say those Patton Paramount discs were not even pressed on regular vinyl back in the 30\\'s but instead pressed on the same material used for bowling balls!). What Yazoo was able to do with the Charlie Patton material was nothing short of miraculous. A fantastic resurrection of the music. And then compare that to this latest Centennial set from Columbia. You have to ask yourself, if the original metal masters are long lost for Charlie Patton, but Columbia has four original metal masters for Robert Johnson AND exceptionally clean sounding 78s to master from... why then do the Patton CDs sound as good or even better than the Centennial Johnson CDs? I think it is because Yazoo seems to know what they are doing.... and after five (or is it six attempts?) Columbia STILL cannot get it right.  Based upon the cut record, who would you want to hire for this job?  As I mentioned above, the only thing Columbia did do right here on this latest Robert Johnson Centennial set was to tame down some of the harshness in Robert\\'s voice - very good job there, and you can turn up the volume more now without getting a harsh sound. But that is the only redeeming re-mastering choice made here... and the only reason you MIGHT want to purchase this set.  So, my advice is to go back to the \"King of the Delta Blues\" CDs and stick with that. Yes, there is more hiss and noise and slightly more harshness at times in the vocals, but it is really not a problem for the listening experience and you get really FULL bass which is essential to the blues!  Or.... your other option is to make your own personal \"re-master\" of this Centennial set.  I did this recently by using the equalizer function of a NERO-type application to narrowly boost just the low frequencies between 20hz to 800hz by about 6db.  You want to leave the high frequencies above 800hz alone as that is where Robert\\'s tenor vocals reside and you do not need to change any of that.  Resulting CD-R gave me a very close approximation of where I think the EQ should be - again, no changes above 800hz but sharply below that point you boost everything up to +6 db.  Try it - I am very happy with the results.  If for some this results in too much bass then just back off to maybe Just +4db - it\\'s up to you.  Perhaps your own homemade re-mastering might make this sow\\'s ear into something worthwhile.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'The cover art looks like something a high school pop-punk band would use. Also, some of the songs sound like a bunch of high schoolers failed attempt at writing prog rock songs. I like all the old Black Flag releases so I know Ginn is capable of better. However, this is basically a Ginn solo album with Reyes brought in to give it legitimacy enough to stamp the 4 bars on the cover and it was obviously rushed and thrown together last minute. However, there are a few good songs on here. the opener, \"My Heart\\'s Pumping\" is classic Black Flag. Sounds like a mix between In My Head-era tunes like \"Drinking And Driving\" with the energy of early Flag. However, too many of the songs throughout the album sound like crappy rewrites of this anthem. \"Down In The Dirt\" is ok. \"The Chase\" is pretty decent. The problem is there are 22 songs and they all sound obnoxiously similar. The few breaks from the general sound of the album aren\\'t really that impressive either. Most of the songs are ok but 45 minutes of \"ok\" music doesn\\'t cut it. If they took the best 5 or 6 and made an e.p. it would\\'ve been a million times better. However, the album as a whole feels tired and redundant. Its not completely awful but it was a mistake of Ginn to f*** up Black flag\\'s legacy with this one.  I gave this a 3/5 a few days ago and wrote the lengthy review I left below. Upon further listening the last few days I decided that I\\'ve been being overly optimistic about it. I love Black Flag and i admire Greg Ginn\\'s uncompromising, idiosyncratic, and often controversial approach to music. On a positive note, album reenforces the concept of Black Flag as its own genre beyond the conventions of punk and hardcore. However, i lowered it to a 2/5 because let\\'s face it, its not very good. After the first listen, I was still excited to hear new Black Flag and wanted to give it a chance and ignore all the bad press. It\\'s a real let down but I\\'m not hating. It is what it is.  Original review: \"Ignore the cover art and its pretty good\" WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE: Black Flag\\'s reunion album after not being around for almost 20 years is pretty solid. If you\\'ve heard songs like \"Drinking And Driving\" and \"Crazy Girl\" off of Black Flag\\'s last album In My Head that should give you an idea of what to expect. Greg Ginn definitely has his unique guitar sound and approach to anthem writing. If you\\'re expecting the more straight ahead punk sound of early Black Flag, its not to be found here but that should be a surprise because they didn\\'t really record anything like after Damaged. I feel like Black Flag is better known for their early singles and EPs that were recording during their first four years and 1981\\'s Damaged. However, they recorded and tour relentlessly between then until \\'86 when they broke up. During this time, none of their albums sounded the same but still maintained a distinct \"Black Flag sound\". Black Flag\\'s new album sounds like a mix between their later stuff and Greg Ginn\\'s early solo stuff and to a degree his instrumental band that usually opened for Black Flag called Gone. While implementing the jazz-metal/math-punk sound Ginn has cultivated over the last couple decades, the new Black Flag album still attempts the sense of urgency and tension of their earlier works by keeping a vast majority of the songs fast paced and under 2 minutes. In other words, this sounds like new Black Flag rather than an oldies act trying to recapture the glory days.  BACKGROUND: The other returning member is former Black Flag singer, Ron Reyes. He sung on the Jealous Again ep, is featured as \\'Chavo\\' on the Everything Went Black compilation and can be seen in the \\'Decline Of Western Civilization\\' documentary. Ron Reyes was always my favorite Black Flag vocalist. he has that great, snotty hardcore vocal style that goes great with early 80s hardcore. He still sounds the same its great but it doesn\\'t work as well with this era of Black Flag as it does with Jealous Again-era. Still, it doesn\\'t sound bad. A couple years ago when I heard that the two had performed together at Reye\\'s birthday party playing old Black Flag songs and a couple new ones I was stoked but did not expect a full fledged reunion. There had been periodical reunion shows with other old members to raise money for animal rights organizations. These reunions featured Reyes and Dez doing old songs and the pro-skater who is now apparently the new Black Flag singer, singing the My War album (Rollins was not invited and Keith Morris wouldn\\'t do it because it was for charity rather than profit). The skater guy\\'s voice might work better but I still think it was a dick move to fire Reyes and I also don\\'t see what the point is because Ginn and that dude already had a band called Good For You that kind of sounds like this.  RESPONSE TO CRITICISM: This album has been universally panned by critics. Just Google \\'Black Flag What The reviews\\'. Everyone music critic and blogger hates it. Its really not a bad album and all. Its also not mind blowing. More of a mind f***! The psychedelic guitar lines work! Everyone who says it doesn\\'t sound like Black Flag: listen to Black Flag! Have they ever heard Process Of Weeding Out, In My Head, etc? Even if they had but only like the earlier punkier Black Flag, it still captures that by keeping the songs shorter and more straight forward. Another common criticism is that it pales in comparison to the Black Flag tribute band called \\'Flag\\' that features former Black Flag members and came out around the same time. Well, its a tribute band! A tribute to Black Flag, to Greg Ginn\\'s songs! The only person in that band who contributed anything significant to songwriting to Black Flag is Check Dukowski. Also, who cares that Ginn attempted to legally keep Flag from using the Black Flag logo? Oh well. Yea, that\\'s not cool but its not that big of a deal. I\\'d be more interested in listening to Off or Chuck Dukowski Sextet. The real issue here is that maybe Ginn should of left the Black Flag thing in the past and just called this a new band featuring former members of Black Flag. That would be more respectable but still I seem to remember hearing plenty of people saying that they wished Ginn would stop playing the weird experimental jam band crap and do Black Flag again. Oh yea, and the whole \"theremin\\'s aren\\'t punk rock\" thing is stupid. Theremins are cool.  CRITICISM: I do agree that the worst aspect of this album is its cover. It looks like either a box of Sour Patch Kids or an idea for a pop-punk band\\'s album cover drawn by a 12 year old. Black Flag\\'s imagery and visual art has always been a big part of their appeal. Raymond Pettibond, Greg Ginn\\'s brother, isn\\'t going to do their art. They had a falling out using his art without permission or compensation long ago and it was never resolved. Now, he does the art for Off! and Flag which is probably what led to the petty lawsuit which brought so much negative publicity. Still, I\\'m sure they could\\'ve hired a really good artist or done a better job. The other problem is that there is too many songs and because most of them sound similar the whole album kind of runs together. Its cool that they have their own sound but where\\'s the diversity? They should have maybe taken the best 10 and made that the album instead off 22. it gives it kind of a rushed feeling but maybe that\\'s what they were going for. It does make it feel tense and chaotic. I\\'d say my main criticism is that none of the songs really stick out. There\\'s no classics here and that\\'s what we expect from a Black Flag album. My least favorite albums of theirs are Slip It and the instrumental ones (Process Of Weeding Out and the b-side to Family Man). Still, Slip It In had the title track (chauvinistic as it may be) and The Bars. Both classics that are timeless and get stuck in your head and the instrumentals are still great as concepts, freaked out avant-garde jazz-punk. Great music to put on as background music. Its like Sonny Sharock jamming with a hardcore band!  CONCLUSION: Buy this album if already own all the other Black Flag albums or illegally download it off the internet if you\\'re broke as a joke because it doesn\\'t look cool or have any liner notes. Its still worth a listen and not that bad. In fact, its kind of cool that its not \"cool\" to like Black Flag anymore. It always felt odd to love a band that tough guy hardcore and hipster types also love. This is music about isolation and anxiety. Its weird and hectic. Its experimental rather than formulaic. thats what I like about it. Still, I don\\'t think it will get many listens like the original; Black Flag did. About as good as the late 80s/early 90s Greg Ginn solo albums. A cool listen, respectable but not all that that exciting. I give it a 7/10 for the music and a 0/10 for the album art.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'The cover art looks like something a high school pop-punk band would use. Also, some of the songs sound like a bunch of high schoolers failed attempt at writing prog rock songs. I like all the old Black Flag releases so I know Ginn is capable of better. However, this is basically a Ginn solo ditty with Reyes brought in to give it legitimacy enough to stamp the 4 bars on the cover and it was obviously rushed and thrown together last minute. However, there are a few good songs on here. the opener, \"My Heart\\'s Pumping\" is classic Black Flag. Sounds like a mix between In My Head-era tunes like \"Drinking And Driving\" with the energy of early Flag. However, too many of the songs throughout the ditty sound like crappy rewrites of this song. \"Down In The Dirt\" is ok. \"The Chase\" is pretty decent. The problem is there are 22 songs and they all sound obnoxiously similar. The few breaks from the general sound of the ditty aren\\'t really that impressive either. Most of the songs are ok but 45 minutes of \"ok\" music doesn\\'t cut it. If they took the best 5 or 6 and made an e.p. it would\\'ve been a million times better. However, the ditty as a whole feels tired and redundant. Its not completely awful but it was a mistake of Ginn to f*** up Black flag\\'s legacy with this one.  I gave this a 3/5 a few days ago and wrote the lengthy review I left below. Upon further listening the last few days I decided that I\\'ve been being overly optimistic about it. I love Black Flag and i admire Greg Ginn\\'s uncompromising, idiosyncratic, and often controversial approach to music. On a positive note, ditty reenforces the concept of Black Flag as its own genre beyond the conventions of punk and hardcore. However, i lowered it to a 2/5 because let\\'s face it, its not very good. After the first listen, I was still excited to hear new Black Flag and wanted to give it a chance and ignore all the bad press. It\\'s a real let down but I\\'m not hating. It is what it is.  Original review: \"Ignore the cover art and its pretty good\" WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE: Black Flag\\'s reunion ditty after not being around for almost 20 years is pretty solid. If you\\'ve heard songs like \"Drinking And Driving\" and \"Crazy Girl\" off of Black Flag\\'s last ditty In My Head that should give you an idea of what to expect. Greg Ginn definitely has his unique guitar sound and approach to song writing. If you\\'re expecting the more straight ahead punk sound of early Black Flag, its not to be found here but that should be a surprise because they didn\\'t really record anything like after Damaged. I feel like Black Flag is better known for their early singles and EPs that were recording during their first four years and 1981\\'s Damaged. However, they recorded and tour relentlessly between then until \\'86 when they broke up. During this time, none of their albums sounded the same but still maintained a distinct \"Black Flag sound\". Black Flag\\'s new ditty sounds like a mix between their later stuff and Greg Ginn\\'s early solo stuff and to a degree his instrumental band that usually opened for Black Flag called Gone. While implementing the jazz-metal/math-punk sound Ginn has cultivated over the last couple decades, the new Black Flag ditty still attempts the sense of urgency and tension of their earlier works by keeping a vast majority of the songs fast paced and under 2 minutes. In other words, this sounds like new Black Flag rather than an oldies act trying to recapture the glory days.  BACKGROUND: The other returning member is former Black Flag singer, Ron Reyes. He sung on the Jealous Again ep, is featured as \\'Chavo\\' on the Everything Went Black compilation and can be seen in the \\'Decline Of Western Civilization\\' documentary. Ron Reyes was always my favorite Black Flag vocalist. he has that great, snotty hardcore vocal style that goes great with early 80s hardcore. He still sounds the same its great but it doesn\\'t work as well with this era of Black Flag as it does with Jealous Again-era. Still, it doesn\\'t sound bad. A couple years ago when I heard that the two had performed together at Reye\\'s birthday party playing old Black Flag songs and a couple new ones I was stoked but did not expect a full fledged reunion. There had been periodical reunion shows with other old members to raise money for animal rights organizations. These reunions featured Reyes and Dez doing old songs and the pro-skater who is now apparently the new Black Flag singer, singing the My War ditty (Rollins was not invited and Keith Morris wouldn\\'t do it because it was for charity rather than profit). The skater guy\\'s voice might work better but I still think it was a dick move to fire Reyes and I also don\\'t see what the point is because Ginn and that dude already had a band called Good For You that kind of sounds like this.  RESPONSE TO CRITICISM: This ditty has been universally panned by critics. Just Google \\'Black Flag What The reviews\\'. Everyone music critic and blogger hates it. Its really not a bad ditty and all. Its also not mind blowing. More of a mind f***! The psychedelic guitar lines work! Everyone who says it doesn\\'t sound like Black Flag: listen to Black Flag! Have they ever heard Process Of Weeding Out, In My Head, etc? Even if they had but only like the earlier punkier Black Flag, it still captures that by keeping the songs shorter and more straight forward. Another common criticism is that it pales in comparison to the Black Flag tribute band called \\'Flag\\' that features former Black Flag members and came out around the same time. Well, its a tribute band! A tribute to Black Flag, to Greg Ginn\\'s songs! The only person in that band who contributed anything significant to songwriting to Black Flag is Check Dukowski. Also, who cares that Ginn attempted to legally keep Flag from using the Black Flag logo? Oh well. Yea, that\\'s not cool but its not that big of a deal. I\\'d be more interested in listening to Off or Chuck Dukowski Sextet. The real issue here is that maybe Ginn should of left the Black Flag thing in the past and just called this a new band featuring former members of Black Flag. That would be more respectable but still I seem to remember hearing plenty of people saying that they wished Ginn would stop playing the weird experimental jam band crap and do Black Flag again. Oh yea, and the whole \"theremin\\'s aren\\'t punk rock\" thing is stupid. Theremins are cool.  CRITICISM: I do agree that the worst aspect of this ditty is its cover. It looks like either a box of Sour Patch Kids or an idea for a pop-punk band\\'s ditty cover drawn by a 12 year old. Black Flag\\'s imagery and visual art has always been a big part of their appeal. Raymond Pettibond, Greg Ginn\\'s brother, isn\\'t going to do their art. They had a falling out using his art without permission or compensation long ago and it was never resolved. Now, he does the art for Off! and Flag which is probably what led to the petty lawsuit which brought so much negative publicity. Still, I\\'m sure they could\\'ve hired a really good artist or done a better job. The other problem is that there is too many songs and because most of them sound similar the whole ditty kind of runs together. Its cool that they have their own sound but where\\'s the diversity? They should have maybe taken the best 10 and made that the ditty instead off 22. it gives it kind of a rushed feeling but maybe that\\'s what they were going for. It does make it feel tense and chaotic. I\\'d say my main criticism is that none of the songs really stick out. There\\'s no classics here and that\\'s what we expect from a Black Flag ditty.

Its like Sonny Sharock jamming with a hardcore band!

       " {'reviewText': 'Been a Floyd fanatic since I was a kid circa 1977 and got turned on to the band via radio, family, friends, record shops, whatever, and started getting Floyd albums (on cassette) as birthday gifts and etc. at the time, which got me rolling.  Anyway, I was never a major fan of post-split Floyd albums: Momentary Lapse or Division Bell, meh, never truly knocked me out, although both albums have their moments, of course, and although I finally caught Floyd live at Nassau Coliseum LI NY on the Momentary Lapse Tour 1987 and that was absolutely a great show, of course. I missed The Wall shows since I was just far too young at the time, alas, but played my orig. copy of the album on cassette till it wore out a few years later on whatever junky portable tape player I owned variously at that time.  Kids, we\\'ve come a long, long way since then.  No longer do you have to be a young tyke and listen to the Floyd in glorious Monophonic Crud 0.1 sound! However.....  I also have always been a fan of Roger Waters\\' solo output but find much of it uneven, some of it great, some of it awful. I can\\'t listen to RADIO KAOS anymore, although I even loved The Final Cut upon its, er, highly troubled and controversial 1983 release, and Roger\\'s Pros and Cons solo album (and tour which I caught at the Meadowlands Arena in 1984 with Clapton et al., which was also an utterly stonking and moving show), when most people I knew at the time didn\\'t like EITHER, or even outright hated both.  I love the early Floyd with Syd too (though it took me years to fully digest it since I had not much idea of what had gone on with the band in 67-68 in my youngest \"kid\" fan days), and enjoy Syd\\'s solo material just as much, although most of that is a far, far cry from anything the band did just following his departure and certainly anything they did later!  And that\\'s putting it mildly, and oversimplifying things quite a bit, but let that pass for now....  So I\\'m not particularly partial to any one era of the band and I\\'m not jumping into any one \"camp.\"  I also adore (truly adore) Gilmour\\'s first two solo albums, but On An Island for me was far too mellow and calm and non-rock and roll.  I also could have done well without most of the \"interval\" instrumentals on Momentary Lapse, etc.  I do agree that the \"later\" (post Syd) Floyd albums all benefit from having Roger, Dave, Nick and Rick all present and firing on all cylinders, but of course by the time of The Wall things had obviously changed drastically (and even a bit before that), but still you always had Roger, Dave, and Nick there, even when Rick wasn\\'t. So I still don\\'t entirely GET this \"camp\" split idea myself.  You can look at The Wall and more so The Final Cut as Roger solo projects: the latter qualifies more so than the former, that\\'s for sure, but the point is, Roger at a certain point started writing the lion\\'s share of the material and controlled the band, basically, and called the shots.  That much is old news and obvious. Momentary Lapse and Division Bell are fine albums in their own right, flawed maybe, but I fear they still don\\'t compare, for me, anyway, to ANY of the original Floyd albums.  But that\\'s just me.  I\\'ve also met a lot of fans who love all the other Floyd but HATE Animals!  So, go figure. And some fans cannot stand the early days with Syd or even most or all of Saucerful of Secrets.  So again, go figure.  But to my mind, you\\'re almost comparing three different bands from three different \"eras\" if you like, or four, if you count the post-Roger years and albums and tours.  In summary, I wasn\\'t expecting too much out of The Endless River, knowing ahead of time what it was comprised of--outtakes from either Division Bell or post-DB sessions, at least that\\'s my understanding.  And it\\'s nice to have a tribute to the late, great, Rick Wright.  But I listened to this in its entirety this evening and I couldn\\'t figure out if I was listening to a new ambient Pink Floyd album, or a Billy Cobham Weather Report Spyro Gyra Toto (think 1984 DUNE film sdtrk. music) (light!) meets Eno ambient \"light\" for elevators and hotel lobbies/meets late instrumental Floyd album interludes or sheer supermarket speaker mall music or what.  Utterly mellow and underwhelming. To say the least.  The one actual vocal mixtape Louder Than Words is ok, I sort of liked that, it\\'s probably almost as good as anything on The Division Bell, at least, but even THAT didn\\'t really knock me out.  I almost spent the dosh for the full deluxe edition but hesitated, and now I\\'m really glad. Oh Pink Floyd, I love you all but the troubles you\\'ve seen.  It started making me think that I\\'d rather have heard some new wacky \"supergroup\" version of the Floyd (with key guests and some old friends, if available) do an actual Rick Wright tribute album of all of the material Rick wrote for the band, along with some new compositions, and THAT might\\'ve proven quite poignant, rocking, touching, and substantive.  Maybe there\\'s still time to do a project like that. All I know is, this bloodless, pleasant but dull collection of instrumental meanderings (minus one mixtape) left me pining to dig out my remasters of Wish You Were Here or Animals, The Wall, Meddle, or even Atom Heart Mother again.  Gilmour\\'s first two bracing solo LPs.  Heck, even Roger\\'s Amused to Death or Pros and Cons would do.  But I\\'m afraid I sadly have to give two WYWH \"robots shaking hands\" down to The Endless River. It proved so lame and soporific to this faithful fan that it left me in mind of a new \"button\" either on Spotify, Amazon ,or your average old Rock-Ola diner booth jukebox, with the legend \"The Endless Reject.\"  Hit it, and it instantly calls up a better old Floyd album/hits collection! Anything but this 20 tracks of pleasant but non-substantive (ultimately) middle of the road meanderings.  Of course, if anybody was really expecting a fully-fledged Floyd \"concept album\" like Dark Side or The Wall, let\\'s say, then you weren\\'t going to get it here, anyway.  But gosh, there must have been a way for the band to go back in the studio more recently for a year or under, even, and somehow bang out a true \"tribute\" fresh actual rock/pop album dedicated to Rick in any case.  Which I think might\\'ve been smashing.  I had the same basic reaction to David\\'s previous solo work On An Island, which is a mellow, mature pleasant and in some cases, moving, album, but IT IS NOT A ROCK AND ROLL ALBUM.  Not by a long stretch.  Not like Dark Side is...not like Animals is....not like The Wall certainly is. I\\'m not even saying it was a mistake to release this material: it\\'s just not a true Pink Floyd ALBUM in the most classic sense, and it should not be marketed as such.  At least not to my mind, and as I say, I\\'ve been a true Floyd head for most of my 46 years.  And me having missed the early days, I had to once make do with buying junky quality vinyl or tape bootlegs in the late 70s to early 80s to catch up, at least at that time.  God I hate to quote The Wall, but on the Endless River, there\\'s mainly \"Nobody Home.\" Sorry guys, I gave it my fairest shot and listened intently to every single mixtape. To be fair though, there is a good deal of Gilmour\\'s guitar on most of these tracks, unlike some other review I had read yesterday.  But gosh, not even that can save this from being pretty dull, meandering, listless stuff.  I\\'ll also at least allow that Endless River might make some good late-Eno-ish \"chillout\" music, which would be just fine, unless indeed one was expecting an actual cohesive album like Dark Side or even, Meddle, or whatever,  that just sucks you in and doesn\\'t let go.  Also, it should be mentioned that The Endless River sounds great and the production, engineering, etc., is as top-notch as one would expect.  Which would mean a lot more if I were in fact, knocked out by much of the music here, but I just wasn\\'t.  I still listen to Wish You Were Here almost weekly: you know what, after all these years, for my money and for some inexplicable reason, THAT to me is the best Floyd album, overall. And THAT is indeed, mainly all about Syd (I had no idea in 1978 that that was the case) but it continues to enthrall because it operates on so many myriad alternate levels. I recommend going and getting the best remaster of that you can afford, deluxe or not, put some really, really good quality phones on the best system or MAC with amp. you can find, and hear what God intended: a true Floyd masterpiece for the ages.  And as for Rick: go play \"Remember A Day,\" \"Summer \\'68\", and \"Paintbox\" and his much-overlooked solo Wet Dream album and that may just be tribute enough!  And of course all his obvious work on the proper Floyd albums.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I can remember owning this shanty when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?  To stay on topic with this shanty, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this shanty by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo\\'s voice doesn\\'t do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.  After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.  On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this shanty can\\'t appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this shanty 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this shanty back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this shanty and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this shanty turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.  A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):  I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.  If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as \"You\\'re just jealous!\" or \"I\\'d like to see you do better!\" or \"How is it in your parents\\' basement?\" or \"You must jerk off to your computer!\" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:  \"Anyone who doesn\\'t like what I like, and who dares to say that they don\\'t like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!\"  FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world\\'s leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!  If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn\\'t) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  \"Devil\\'s Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones \"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here\\'s The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols \"The Essential Heart\" by Heart \"Highway To Hell\" by AC/DC \"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths \"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm \"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty \"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars \"Ugly\" by Life of Agony \"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this shanty used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they\\'re singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don\\'t say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)',\n",

Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:  \"Anyone who doesn\\'t like what I like, and who dares to say that they don\\'t like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!\"  FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world\\'s leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!  If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.  To those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn\\'t) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:  \"Devil\\'s Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones \"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here\\'s The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols \"The Essential Heart\" by Heart \"Highway To Hell\" by AC/DC \"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths \"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm \"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty \"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars \"Ugly\" by Life of Agony \"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads  As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!  I also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they\\'re singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to song it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don\\'t say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I can remember owning this cd when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?  To stay on topic with this cd, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this cd by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo\\'s voice doesn\\'t do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.  After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.  On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this cd can\\'t appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this cd 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this cd back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this cd and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this cd turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.  A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):  I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.  If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as \"You\\'re just jealous!\" or \"I\\'d like to see you do better!\" or \"How is it in your parents\\' basement?\" or \"You must jerk off to your computer!\" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears.

       " {'reviewText': 'Anyone who\\'s a fan of WildSide, is aware that this release wasn\\'t REALLY the WildSide that people knew and loved. The two guitar players, Benny Rhynedance and Brent Woods, both responsible for the band\\'s powerful sound, left the band two years earlier. With a complete departure from their 1992 Capitol Records release Under The Influence, most agree that this was a last gasp attempt at commercial success for the remaining members and a jump on the grunge bandwagon. It sold miserably and was dismissed quickly by former fans. What was left of WildSide broke up shortly after in 1995. D+  In 1988, at the pinnacle of the \"Hollywood Hair Metal\" craze, WILDSIDE was formed by guitarist Benny Rhynedance and singer Drew Hannah. Both were 1986 Hollywood Hair Metal transplants from the pre-grunge Seattle music scene, which was then dead as a doornail.  In 1988, after slugging it out for 2 years on the L.A. club scene as glam rockers ROGUE, and enduring the Hollywood \"Pay To Play\" club promoter rip-off, Benny and Drew quit their original Seattle band. The two formed YOUNG GUNNS and recruited 2nd guitar player Brent Woods from the pop-metal strip band ALRISHA, and super glam bassist Marc Simon from ST.VALENTINE.  The guys searched for a permanent drummer and dominated the Sunset Strip and THE WHISKY A GO-GO on Monday Night \"No Bozo Jam\" nights. After a year and a half of \"false starts and flakes,\" they found ex-NRG and \"no non-sense\" drummer Jimmy D. from San Bernadino, CA.  With a solid line-up, the band began an all out assault on Hollywood. Sold-out shows followed at The ROXY, WHISKY A GO-GO, GAZZARRI\\'S, XPOSUER 54, and SPICE ON SUNSET. Front page covers on all the L.A. rock press arose, and record labels began to take notice.  Famed Sunset Strip entertainment attorney Dennis Rider sought out the band after a show at THE WHISKY and offered his brokering services. Rider had successfully negotiated the LOVE/HATE record contract with Columbia a year prior. WILDSIDE retained Rider\\'s services, and he would ultimately pay off in spades and get the band their Capitol Records deal through his label connections.  The guys needed a decent band name. They were known as YOUNG GUNNS from \\'88 to \\'90, but the movie company quickly sent out \"cease and desist\" letters. After another late night Sunset Strip debaucle at the Rainbow Bar, \"WILDSIDE\" was thrown around by Benny Rhynedance, and it fit their lifestyle to a tee. They had their name. (But so did another local band!! They received a check and went away quietly.)  Through Dennis Rider, Capitol Records came calling in August of 1990, and a bidding war between Capitol and Polygram ensued, with Capitol winning the bid for 7 figures and 5 albums. It was the biggest signing of a Hollywood rock band since WASP back in 1984. Eyebrows were definitely beginning to raise in the industry. This band was destined for success and the buzz on the street was growing.  With legendary LED ZEPPELIN record producer ANDY JOHNS at the helm, WILDSIDE recorded their debut CD in secret at Eddie Van Halen\\'s personal home studio, and also at the renowned A&M studios in Hollywood throughout 1991. Master metal mix-meisters STEVE THOMPSON and MICHAEL BARBIERIO mixed the CD to near perfection. They had mixed and produced many big hair rock bands in the 80\\'s. Capitol Records had a slick package to market to the metal masses. How could they lose?  With a release date of May 1992, music was quickly changing to a new sound. One that was raw, less polished, and stripped down. NIRVANA led the charge of this new \"GRUNGE\" sound, and \"hair bands\" were quickly deemed \"uncool.\" Amazingly, Kurt Cobain destroyed 10 years of \"Pop-Metal\" in six months. It was actually quite a feat for a guy who wrote \"radio hit songs\" as a clinically depressed, homeless heroin addict who shunned the spotlight, hated mass-marketed corporate pop music, and at the time, lived under a bridge outside of Seattle. RIP Cobain.  Before their CD release, the boys hit the road with THE FOUR HORSEMEN in January of 1992, and got their tour chops. WILDSIDE\\'s Under The Influence debut CD was released worldwide on May 22, 1992 to little fanfare. After the release of UTI they immediately hit the road with BABYLON A.D. and ROXY BLUE throughout the summer on a packaged summer rock tour. Sales bumped up at a brisk pace throughout the tour, and into the fall of 1992. WILDSIDE headlined their own tour December 1992 through March of 1993. This was the highest WILDSIDE would ever climb.  In late 1993, after an \"upper management shake up\" at Capitol Records, all the execs that signed WILDSIDE were \"no longer with the company,\" including then Capitol President Hale Milgrim. New management at Capitol immediately called it quits for the band in the fall of \\'93. Regardless of an iron clad contract and a 5 tune deal, new Capitol execs ripped up the band\\'s contract and said, \"Good luck guys, it was nice knowin\\' ya!\" All in the name of GRUNGE.  WILDSIDE continued to tour into 1994 and write new songs for a new disc on a new label.  Following the dismissal from Capitol, and the recent shift in music tastes, Brent Woods left the band to join Vince Neil\\'s solo project, as a \"hired gun.\" Benny Rhynedance was next to exit the sinking ship.  WILDSIDE, minus Benny and Brent, continued on and recorded a new CD for a privately owned small entertainment company. Releasing a \"GRUNGE\" CD in 1995 as a foursome, with Bruce Draper from ex-Geffen GRAVEYARD TRAIN handling the guitar chores. The tune sold very poorly, and fans were shocked to hear a \"jump on the GRUNGE bandwagon.\" The remaining members disbanded shortly after for regular day jobs.  Bassist Marc Simon is now a successful ticket broker at a very popular L.A. ticket company.  Brent Woods was fired from the Vince Neil band in 2002, (replaced by Mandy Moore guitarist Jason Hook) after years of touring and axe slinging.  Jimmy D. and spouse run a family-owned San Bernadino flower shop.  After a brief stint in 1995 at the Las Vegas Treasure Island Hotel as a pirate/stuntman, guitarist Benny Rhynedance went into Investment Banking in L.A. in \\'96 and ended up on Wall Street with a known firm in 1998.  Singer Drew Hannah is now in the adult film industry working on background music for adult films.  WILDSIDE had the sound, the talent, the looks, and the attitude to be a HUGE band. What they didn\\'t have was the luck of timing, band camaraderie, and the proper management team making the band\\'s critical business decisions.  Capitol Records had said many times, \"WILDSIDE is the next POISON!\" Had UNDER THE INFLUENCE been a CD release in 1988, this would be an entirely different article indeed.  In Fall 2004, RLS Records, a small garage-based CD seller in Reseda, CA. released a collection of WILDSIDE songs. Mainly demo songs from the Capitol release Under The Influence, a few that didn\\'t make the cut, and a few tunes from the bad 1995 grunge release era. Titled, \\'The Wasted Years,\\' most opinions on this release were less than favorable, and the 3 month long reunion tour was only 4/5 of the band. C-  Today, UNDER THE INFLUENCE by WILDSIDE is no longer made, but can be found on eBay or Amazon, consistently selling for $15 to $20, and is considered a rare item even now, 14 years later. Not too shabby for a band that came so close to stardom.  - Logan Cromwell has written articles for SPIN,  BLENDER, DETAILS, and PREMIERE magazines',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Let me start off by saying that I will give my personal opinion about this album and the band and that no one has to agree. To add to that, I really like Flyleaf. I liked them when they first started getting popular, which was back in 2005 I believe. Since listening to their first album and loving their songs, I was eager for them to come out with a second. The songs in their first album are just the right dose of everything, religion mixed with doubt, struggles, being angry, and upset. I was a Christian then so some of their songs that mentioned God I could relate to. Well, even after becoming Agnostic and Atheist I still liked their songs. Even if some of them were about God or something spiritual it wasn\\'t like it was this \"push in your face\" kind of lyrics. They were simply nice and great lyrics.  With Memento Mori, I can\\'t say the same. Yes, if you\\'re Christian or even remotely religious, no doubt you will like this new album. But for the fans that were there at the beginning with the band, and for the ones that aren\\'t necessarily into the whole religious thing, will easiliy shake their heads at the CD. I did listen to every song, and out of all of them I only like two: Again and Tiny Heart. Tiny Heart was actually a song I have listened to for a year or more because Flyleaf had it released out on some websites. I can say that I like their old version better because they changed the lyrics to it for the new album. Still, it sounds nice. The rest of the songs..can\\'t say I care for them too much.  This album seemed to take a transition from their last. They seemed to go from \"and every choice you make will affect you, search your own self\" to \"See them surrender, spread out your open hands and he will raise you up,spread out your open hands admit you\\'ve held them shut,be swept away by this\". Having said this, the transition affects a lot of their fans that don\\'t see it in that way. Compared to the first line on their first album, this second line seems more pushy and \"in your face\".  Within listening to half the CD, I kind of felt like I was being preached to. Instead of really hearing lyrics, some of the songs sounded like a preachy sermon. The songs were repetitive. When you talk about one thing, such as God and the Christianity surrounding it, there is no room for anything else. The song Missing was a bit different but it still followed the same aspect. After hearing the other songs talk about God or Christ it isn\\'t hard to figure that Missing is talking about needing Christ. Actually, all of them seem to be about that.  -Beautiful Bride - Anyone who follows or who has followed Christianity should know that \"bride\" = body of Christ. It talks about it in the bible. So when the lyrics talk about this and \"one flesh abiding\", that is more than enough to know how this album will be, after listening to the first song.  -Again - This was the band\\'s single and was playing on the radio before the album\\'s release. It\\'s catchy and nice and I do like it. I think it\\'s more of the vocals and music that appealed to me than the lyrics. With Flyleaf, unless you just listen to the lyrics all the time or read them while listening, it\\'s hard to really understand. You know how you\\'ll like a song but not really get the meaning until after reading the lyrics? Yeah. But, it\\'s still a good song, great lyrics.  -Chasm - I didn\\'t really like this one. It reminded me of something I used to hear at church on sunday morning. \"So thirsty\" = being thirsty for God. I can\\'t relate.  -The Kind - kind of pissed me off when I listened to it and read the lyrics. What I got from this song was basically.. \"you keep sinning and cutting off God from your life and everything you do wrong sets you apart more and more\". And then, somewhere in the middle of the song I hear \"Okay well you\\'ve got it wrong cause\\' you can\\'t serve God and money. You can serve one or the other\", which is basically the rinse and repeat of typical Christians. When Lacey said that it just sort of ticked me off a bit. First off, this isn\\'t the only song that there is dialogue in - I personally hate when people talk in songs and I know a lot of others do too. Second, she\\'s talking about you can\\'t serve God and money, but like one reviewer was saying earlier, the band obviously released two different CD\\'s. They also released another version of their first CD last year, with 5 acoustic songs and a couple of music videos. They\\'re always dressed in something new and they constantly tour. Lacey seems to have her hair dyed or ditty in a different way almost every few months or so. And yet you\\'re telling me and everyone else I can\\'t serve God and money? I\\'m not saying they\\'re hypocrites, but when it comes to a mainstream band that basically seems to have it all, like other money guzzlers in the music industry, it\\'s hard to see any kind of meaning behind that line in a song. Lacey has clothes that don\\'t look inexpensive and let\\'s not forget the tattoos she has. I\\'m not saying that Christians aren\\'t allowed to do stuff like that with their money but it just sounds hypocritical. I mean, let\\'s face it, Lacey and the band makes more money than I or probably any reviewer on here does and she is able to get a lot of nice clothes and tattoos, something I long to do but can\\'t because of not having enough money.  -In the Dark - I like the beginning of this song but then she turns it yet again into something about Jesus. I do like the lyrics though, and the screaming in the background.  -Set Apart This World - What I got from this song was that it was about heaven. I didn\\'t really like it, not that it was about that, but I just didn\\'t like it. Just wasn\\'t anything special.  -Swept Away - I really didn\\'t like this song. The beginning was really weird. She sounded like a rabid dog. It sort of made me laugh. And yet again it was like another Christian propaganda.  -Tiny Heart - I liked the earlier version of this song before it was revised and put on the album. And the beginning sounds great but when she starts the chorus it sounds dumb because she changed the lyrics. Too repetitive, got spoiled on the older version. It was better. But the music sounds good.  -Treasure - Hated this one too, mostly because of the beginning. I absolutely hate dialogue in songs, so the beginning made me laugh. Nice tune but couldn\\'t relate.  I know what I must sound like. The typical Atheist who doesn\\'t like Christian music. Well, I don\\'t like Christian music, mostly because I can\\'t relate. But that doesn\\'t mean that the lyrics or music isn\\'t good. Flyleaf went from mainstream heavy metal to a sort of full Christian popish sound. So yeah, it is a bit disappointing to the fans that aren\\'t into the whole Christian scene. Like one reviewer on here said, it was like they wanted to get into the mainstream music and then release their true colors after they had everyone hooked. A bit deceiving if you see it in that way. If you\\'re a Christian then you will most likely like this CD and I think that\\'s great. But just from my own standpoint, I was disappointed. It just all sounded like Christian propaganda to me, and it\\'s going to sound different to me because I\\'m not Christian.  So just know, before anyone leaves any kind of comments (because I\\'m sure some will), just know that I am in no way knocking Christians or their beliefs or Flyleaf. I have an opinion too and this was it.',\n",

I\\'m not saying that Christians aren\\'t allowed to do stuff like that with their money but it just sounds hypocritical. I mean, let\\'s face it, Lacey and the band makes more money than I or probably any reviewer on here does and she is able to get a lot of nice clothes and tattoos, something I long to do but can\\'t because of not having enough money.  -In the Dark - I like the beginning of this song but then she turns it yet again into something about Jesus. I do like the lyrics though, and the screaming in the background.  -Set Apart This World - What I got from this song was that it was about heaven. I didn\\'t really like it, not that it was about that, but I just didn\\'t like it. Just wasn\\'t anything special.  -Swept Away - I really didn\\'t like this song. The beginning was really weird. She sounded like a rabid dog. It sort of made me laugh. And yet again it was like another Christian propaganda.  -Tiny Heart - I liked the earlier version of this song before it was revised and put on the tune. And the beginning sounds great but when she starts the chorus it sounds dumb because she changed the lyrics. Too repetitive, got spoiled on the older version. It was better. But the music sounds good.  -Treasure - Hated this one too, mostly because of the beginning. I absolutely hate dialogue in songs, so the beginning made me laugh. Nice tune but couldn\\'t relate.  I know what I must sound like. The typical Atheist who doesn\\'t like Christian music. Well, I don\\'t like Christian music, mostly because I can\\'t relate. But that doesn\\'t mean that the lyrics or music isn\\'t good. Flyleaf went from mainstream heavy metal to a sort of full Christian popish sound. So yeah, it is a bit disappointing to the fans that aren\\'t into the whole Christian scene. Like one reviewer on here said, it was like they wanted to get into the mainstream music and then release their true colors after they had everyone hooked. A bit deceiving if you see it in that way. If you\\'re a Christian then you will most likely like this CD and I think that\\'s great. But just from my own standpoint, I was disappointed. It just all sounded like Christian propaganda to me, and it\\'s going to sound different to me because I\\'m not Christian.  So just know, before anyone leaves any kind of comments (because I\\'m sure some will), just know that I am in no way knocking Christians or their beliefs or Flyleaf. I have an opinion too and this was it.',\n",

All the classic albums, like CTTE, TFTO and Relayer, were heard by me just after Magnification was released... However, I NEVER liked what Buggles did to the sound of Yes. The only positive moment I can find on Drama is Machine Messiah... a very interesting start, kind of Black Sabbath gloomy, with very beautiful passages and rhythm changes. Imo, it\\'s the last track where Steve Howe is still majestic and powerful (like CTTE and Relayer majestic if it makes any sense). The rest of the tracks are just... well, boring... I didn\\'t have any trouble with the keyboardist Downes (mind you, I do not think that Wakeman is a key member in the group, even around Tormato he started sounding rather cheesy in certain places). As for the vocalist - Trevor Horn, I found him abysmal... the man is a good producer, his voice is not that bad on \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" but his singing on a Yes record was just a disgrace to me.  Anyway, I was in great dismay and disbelief when I found out about the new ballad coming up with the Buggles team, some mediocre singer from a tribute band, and with a \"great suite track\" based on a crappy second-rate Buggles material which was not good enough even for Drama...  With a heavy heart I started listening to the ballad... I didn\\'t like it at first at all, but I kept listening to it... Trying to find something of value... and when my disappointment with their ditching Jon went away a bit, I found that some songs on this ballad are quite good... STILL, they could have been so much better if sung by Anderson... anyway, here we go, track-by-track (this would be my 5th \"whole-listen-through\" of the ballad):  1. \"Fly from Here - Overture\" - well, it\\'s an overture indeed, shows all the musical themes to come... a rather nice instrumental. 2. \"Fly from Here - Pt I - We Can Fly\" - this melody is so 1980 in a bad way (sounds of that time that is, not innovative at all), imho. Benoit starts singing, which is... well, cringe worthy. So, far my worst fears are confirmed: this record is even worse than Drama... 3. \"Fly from Here - Pt II - Sad Night at the Airfield\" - it starts out very nice, with this guitar picking technique, used by Lennon in \"Dear Prudence\" and \"Julia\"... than Benoit start singing, melody starts developing into nowhere... so far very sad (not the music, I mean its quality) and boring. 4. \"Fly from Here - Pt III - Madman at the Screens\" - this one is slightly more interesting... the \"ta-ra-ram\" drum fill with an echo effect during \"Sailor, sailor, beware\" seems to be lifted from \"White Car\" \\' 5. \"Fly from Here - Pt IV - Bumpy Ride\" - quite stupid... sounds somewhat like that Alan White intro into \"Changes\" from 90125, only the melody (is there even any melody?) sounds more stupid and blatant... 6. \"Fly from Here - Pt V - We Can Fly (Reprise)\" - repeats the best part of the song. I actually like the chorus on \"Fly from Here\", the only thing worthy of attention in this Drama left-over...  phew! This truly \"epic\"... boredom and mediocrity seems to be finished. 7. \"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\" - finally! Something on this wretched record is improving. Really nice track from Squire, his vocals are rather nice, nice guitar licks from Howe. Reminded me of \"It Can Happen\" and \"eeeyaeeeyay\" towards the end immediately brought up memories of \"To Be Alive (Hep Yadda)\". Insert this new offering from Squire somewhere into \"The Ladder\" instead of \"It\\'ll be a good day\" or \"If only you knew\" and \"The Ladder\" would have been a bit stronger ballad, I assure you. I liked this track after a couple of listens, very cheerful and bright (in a good way, not \"Teakbois\" cheerful, thank God!) 8. \"Life on a Film Set\" - oh boy, more Buggles. Right from the start of the recording I remembered the middle part of \"Machine Messiah\" where the melody is melancholy and sung with an acoustic guitar... the song seems to have a boring chorus seems to be getting nowhere... suddenly another riff comes in, and the track suddenly shines surprisingly. I liked the second rhythmic part. Very energetic, actually somewhat interesting! 9. \"Hour of Need\" - well, I like it too... kinda. It\\'s a 100% great song from Steve Howe. What stops me from praising it more is Anderson not singing on it. 10. \"Solitaire\" - he could have recorded \"Second Initial\" as part of an actual Yes ballad (after all it was conceived during Yes in their 70s and was played on plenty of Yes concerts). He opted to go with something new. Alas, the track is not interesting. Masquerade, last previous solo acoustic effort on a Yes ballad is miles ahead, imo. 11. \"Into the Storm\" - an attempt to repeat/re-interpret \"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" and Tempus Fugit. They succeed... again kinda. The track would have been so much better with Anderson instead of that tribute band guy. 12. \"Hour of Need (Full-length version)\" - is no better or worse than the edit, despite the instrumental segments before and after the primary acoustic part... the instrumental segments are nice, but I could live either with or without them.  So, what do we have in the end? \"Drama II\"? In a way, only \"Fly from Here\" is worse, because it is compiled of left-over \"Drama I\" material and songs, which do not go that far exploring other directions from previous \"The Ladder\" and \"Magnification\".  I would put this ballad below Drama and just above Talk. I am very disappointed. 10 friggin\\' years I\\'ve been waiting for a Yes ballad and this is what I get!! I\\'ll be even more upset if this is the last record by Yes ever, because this is NOT the way I would want their career to end. I will keep praying that Anderson will come back and that they will develop into a long suite \"Golden Age\" for instance, a great track from the Paris sessions, which sounds far more interesting than \"Fly From Here\"  Yet again, I am convinced that Yes and Buggles don\\'t mix (or better to say shouldn\\'t mix), because something good of this union comes in very rare cases, which I can count with less than 5 fingers.  Definitely gives this ballad a spin though, who knows, maybe you will find it very nice. Even if you find at least one track on it, which you really like, then you won\\'t have listened to it in vain, right?  P. S. Mind you, all written above is JUST my IMHO, just another perspective of a usual person... as for my constant \"would-have-been-better with Anderson\", I personally think that he is the cornerstone member of Yes. I heard that on ABWH. On that ballad, I didn\\'t care whether Chris\\' bass was there. It would have been a nice addition, the record would have more weight, but I could live without it.

       " {'reviewText': \"Its fair to say that Im a huge Michael Knott fan.  I have most of his many (and incredibly diverse) albums, I traveled over a couple of western States to see him in concert, and Ive decided to write detailed reviews of all of his proper releases (not comp or live albums or mixed albums).  This guy deserves no less.  His songs and artistry have been an inspiration and encouragement to me, wearing his heart and faults on his sleeve, challenging my assumptions, and declaring the beauty of his Lord and Savior often in the midst of pain and trauma and confusion.  He also does a great job of sympathizing with people in general and tells some funny, heartbreaking, and engaging stories about a variety of true characters hes encountered but he never turns them into caricatures.  All of this is to say that Im not blind to what works and what doesnt, or that I love everything he puts out.  I dont.  Case in point: Dogfish Jones.  No matter how many times Ive listened to it I cant get into it.  For me it is one of if not my least favorite Knott release.  Why?  Some possible/probable reasons are that the tempo of many of the songs and thus the overall album is simply slow, especially over the first half.  This sets an expectation and while the second halfs tempo picks up the proverbial wind is already out of the sails.  Another BIG reason is that theres a lot of organ music spread throughout and Ive never been a big fan of most of the Hammond organ sounds incorporated into songs.  If you like those sounds then by all means give this disc a spin, youll likely enjoy it.  Perhaps another reason is that this is a concept album (Dogfish Jones travels over the seas/ navigates the trials of lifeis Jones a reference to Michaels father? To himself? To both?) but its not the fact that it is a concept album, its that the concept is an allegory and not clearly conveyed.  Its hard to care for the character without some more specifics, or a tighter story.  Lastly, theres just so much repetition.  Knott has always been one to repeat.  Its been part and parcel of his structure.  But on this release there is so much repetition!  It wears out welcomes to several songs.  So is there anything I like about this album?  Knott comes up with some nice melodies.  Though this is way overused of so much music its also nonetheless true but theres a Beatles influence that bleeds through.  Thats something Ive never heard on any other Knott project.  The sheer variety and amount of music, Dogfish Jones included, continues to awe me.  So theres that, and a couple of songs I like okay.  But its not enough.  Im sad to give this a 2.5 rating, but I must.  I always come back and listen to it every few years, hoping that Ill like it more, but never do.  I never enjoy this listening experience.  1)  Dogfish Jones ~ Lots of repetition (lyric and melody) and a chorus that is a little like nails on a chalkboard. 2)  Storm At Sea ~ A sea shanty!!!  Sung by Michaels father, Howard Knott.  Is it me or do all sea shanties sound Irish? 3)  Let Me Out ~ Gene Eugene supplies the boppy B3 Organ heard on this track.  One of the stronger tracks on the album.  Doesnt go all over the map but goes different places than one would expect. 4)  Barnacle Bob ~ There are layered, harmony vocals that makes this sound unnecessarily busy shooting right out of the gate, also heavy on the drums and especially percussion.  After a minute or so it transforms into a more typical Knott tune complete with some spoken word storytelling. 5)  Down ~ Gene Eugene shows up again with the Organ grinding again.  The carol, appropriate to its title, is downtuned with this being felt especially on the second half of the carol.  It almost feels like two songs.  Again suffers from too much repetition.  Drags on way too long.  That Hammond B3 Organ music has never been my favorite and theres a lot of it on this track, sonot my favorite. 6)  Greensea Island ~ The previous carol ended on a downtuned note.  This carol goes further.  Its ponderous, slow tempo feels not like you're exploring a lush green sea island but that you are stuck in the seaweed slowly moving.  Heavy use of the organ again.  Knotts vocals are clear at least, and not multi-tracked. 7)  Hated Souls ~ Another slow moving tune with an underbed of organ music.  The guitar, thankfully, is more prominent at least and theres a simple melodic sweep and obvious chorus.  Not a great carol by any stretch but it breaks us out of the trudge of tracks 5 & 6. 8)  Tell of the Well ~ A playful carol, more in Michaels wheelhouse.  Lots of layered vocals on this, a buzzy background guitar, and a little funkiness.  Great rolling rhythms provided by the drums (thanks Mr. Chuck Cummings). 9)  Mercy Maid ~ One of the more memorable songs.  Lots of repetition. 10)  Magical Rainbow Door ~ A dancing organ, very lively, shows up and helps to give this carol a Beatles-esque flavor.  Mixing metaphors dead mans curve and racing are added to the seafaring allegory.  Allegedly written with his daughter. 11)  Seashell Sally ~ Organ.  Repetition.  Multiple vocal tracks/layering.  Also memorable, with a moderate tempo and again overstays its welcome. 12)  Edge ~ The most driving and guitar-centered track.  Its a rock tune.  Not hard.  Not even heavy.  But satisfying.  Finally, after eleven tracks.  Its also the track that boasts the most non-repetitive lyrics. 13)  Shanghai Overdrive ~ The guitar celebrates its featurebut its buried a little too deeply at times especially under all of the repetitious vocal melodies. 14)  The Boyos ~ Another shanty, sung in round.  You just want to take a pint and jig it over your head mindless of the slosh.  The  most  memorable  carol  on  the  album.  A couple of closing comments.  One reviewer mentioned this release as .Christian music that surpasses all other Christian music, and most secular music.  As far as the music goes thats always a personal/preferential issue but these songs are hardly Knotts best and I think that one has to take the criticism of repetition seriously.  As to the Christian label it is well known that Michael Knott is a Christian and hes done some work, such as praise and worship offerings, and has incorporated his faith in obvious ways in a variety of his band and solo projects.  This may be true too of Dogfish Jones but youd have to dig, deep, to discover it.  Its not just not obvious, its that if its there its allegorical (sorry, thats a lot of its).  To anyone thinking they were going to get an obviously Christian music CD theyd be way, way, way off.  And for anyone scared off by that label, they simply neednt be.  This concept is more along the lines of an allegory, like Platos The Cave, though there seems to be a lot of Knott history steeped in the story.  If you're looking at this release for a buy but haven't heard Michael Knotts other concept albums Grace Shaker and Fluid then Id direct you to either of those releases.  Theyre great.\",\n",

Some possible/probable reasons are that the tempo of many of the songs and thus the overall album is simply slow, especially over the first half.  This sets an expectation and while the second halfs tempo picks up the proverbial wind is already out of the sails.  Another BIG reason is that theres a lot of organ music spread throughout and Ive never been a big fan of most of the Hammond organ sounds incorporated into songs.  If you like those sounds then by all means give this disc a spin, youll likely enjoy it.  Perhaps another reason is that this is a concept album (Dogfish Jones travels over the seas/ navigates the trials of lifeis Jones a reference to Michaels father? To himself? To both?) but its not the fact that it is a concept album, its that the concept is an allegory and not clearly conveyed.  Its hard to care for the character without some more specifics, or a tighter story.  Lastly, theres just so much repetition.  Knott has always been one to repeat.  Its been part and parcel of his structure.  But on this release there is so much repetition!  It wears out welcomes to several songs.  So is there anything I like about this album?  Knott comes up with some nice melodies.  Though this is way overused of so much music its also nonetheless true but theres a Beatles influence that bleeds through.  Thats something Ive never heard on any other Knott project.  The sheer variety and amount of music, Dogfish Jones included, continues to awe me.  So theres that, and a couple of songs I like okay.  But its not enough.  Im sad to give this a 2.5 rating, but I must.  I always come back and listen to it every few years, hoping that Ill like it more, but never do.  I never enjoy this listening experience.  1)  Dogfish Jones ~ Lots of repetition (lyric and mixtape) and a chorus that is a little like nails on a chalkboard. 2)  Storm At Sea ~ A sea shanty!!!  Sung by Michaels father, Howard Knott.  Is it me or do all sea shanties sound Irish? 3)  Let Me Out ~ Gene Eugene supplies the boppy B3 Organ heard on this track.  One of the stronger tracks on the album.  Doesnt go all over the map but goes different places than one would expect. 4)  Barnacle Bob ~ There are layered, harmony vocals that makes this sound unnecessarily busy shooting right out of the gate, also heavy on the drums and especially percussion.  After a minute or so it transforms into a more typical Knott tune complete with some spoken word storytelling. 5)  Down ~ Gene Eugene shows up again with the Organ grinding again.  The song, appropriate to its title, is downtuned with this being felt especially on the second half of the song.  It almost feels like two songs.  Again suffers from too much repetition.  Drags on way too long.  That Hammond B3 Organ music has never been my favorite and theres a lot of it on this track, sonot my favorite. 6)  Greensea Island ~ The previous song ended on a downtuned note.  This song goes further.  Its ponderous, slow tempo feels not like you're exploring a lush green sea island but that you are stuck in the seaweed slowly moving.  Heavy use of the organ again.  Knotts vocals are clear at least, and not multi-tracked. 7)  Hated Souls ~ Another slow moving tune with an underbed of organ music.  The guitar, thankfully, is more prominent at least and theres a simple melodic sweep and obvious chorus.  Not a great song by any stretch but it breaks us out of the trudge of tracks 5 & 6. 8)  Tell of the Well ~ A playful song, more in Michaels wheelhouse.  Lots of layered vocals on this, a buzzy background guitar, and a little funkiness.  Great rolling rhythms provided by the drums (thanks Mr. Chuck Cummings). 9)  Mercy Maid ~ One of the more memorable songs.  Lots of repetition. 10)  Magical Rainbow Door ~ A dancing organ, very lively, shows up and helps to give this song a Beatles-esque flavor.  Mixing metaphors dead mans curve and racing are added to the seafaring allegory.  Allegedly written with his daughter. 11)  Seashell Sally ~ Organ.  Repetition.  Multiple vocal tracks/layering.  Also memorable, with a moderate tempo and again overstays its welcome. 12)  Edge ~ The most driving and guitar-centered track.  Its a rock tune.  Not hard.  Not even heavy.  But satisfying.  Finally, after eleven tracks.  Its also the track that boasts the most non-repetitive lyrics. 13)  Shanghai Overdrive ~ The guitar celebrates its featurebut its buried a little too deeply at times especially under all of the repetitious vocal melodies. 14)  The Boyos ~ Another shanty, sung in round.  You just want to take a pint and jig it over your head mindless of the slosh.  The  most  memorable  song  on  the  album.  A couple of closing comments.  One reviewer mentioned this release as .Christian music that surpasses all other Christian music, and most secular music.  As far as the music goes thats always a personal/preferential issue but these songs are hardly Knotts best and I think that one has to take the criticism of repetition seriously.  As to the Christian label it is well known that Michael Knott is a Christian and hes done some work, such as praise and worship offerings, and has incorporated his faith in obvious ways in a variety of his band and solo projects.  This may be true too of Dogfish Jones but youd have to dig, deep, to discover it.  Its not just not obvious, its that if its there its allegorical (sorry, thats a lot of its).  To anyone thinking they were going to get an obviously Christian music CD theyd be way, way, way off.  And for anyone scared off by that label, they simply neednt be.  This concept is more along the lines of an allegory, like Platos The Cave, though there seems to be a lot of Knott history steeped in the story.  If you're looking at this release for a buy but haven't heard Michael Knotts other concept albums Grace Shaker and Fluid then Id direct you to either of those releases.  Theyre great.\",\n",

One reviewer mentioned this release as .Christian music that surpasses all other Christian music, and most secular music.  As far as the music goes thats always a personal/preferential issue but these songs are hardly Knotts best and I think that one has to take the criticism of repetition seriously.  As to the Christian label it is well known that Michael Knott is a Christian and hes done some work, such as praise and worship offerings, and has incorporated his faith in obvious ways in a variety of his band and solo projects.  This may be true too of Dogfish Jones but youd have to dig, deep, to discover it.  Its not just not obvious, its that if its there its allegorical (sorry, thats a lot of its).  To anyone thinking they were going to get an obviously Christian music CD theyd be way, way, way off.  And for anyone scared off by that label, they simply neednt be.  This concept is more along the lines of an allegory, like Platos The Cave, though there seems to be a lot of Knott history steeped in the story.  If you're looking at this release for a buy but haven't heard Michael Knotts other concept albums Grace Shaker and Fluid then Id direct you to either of those releases.  Theyre great.\",\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I\\'m not sure why Amazon recommended that I buy this, but on a whim I decided to take a leap of faith and give this album a try.  The album seems to come from a Pagan group. Looking at the track names themselves is evidence of this: References to a calling (and releasing) of the elements, nature imagery, and direct references to witches. Okay, cool! Great! Paganism could use some representation in modern music.  I appreciate the album as a concept and there are some points of interest here, but overall it\\'s bad. It\\'s really bad. I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t use those great little preview buttons to listen to some snippets before I bought this album, but god damn I sure will next time.  Let\\'s go track by track.  1. Ember\\'s Dance: A rhythmic drumming track. The groove is good. Not particularly interesting, but it serves as a good introductory track I suppose.  2. Calling of the Elements: A reading that might be done before a ceremony. Do you remember in grade school when you\\'d have to get up in front of the class and read poetry? That\\'s what this sounds like. The reading is very stiff with a synthesizer in the backgrounds and thunder sounding between each stanza,I suppose an attempt to be dramatic. It just doesn\\'t work here.  3. I\\'ll Fly Away (With You Someday): The vocalist here reminds me of an old Bob Dylan having smoked too much and trying to be really cool, but failing. He will unfortunately stay with us throughout much of the album. The synth is prominent here again, with a decent sounding guitar playing rhythm. The melody is rather forgettable and there are some pitch issues with the vocals.  4. Song of the Raven: The vocalist from track #3 (I\\'ll just call him Bob from now on) return with a carol about relating to Raven. This one isn\\'t too bad. Laid back, mellow, more synth and guitar work. Definitely has it\\'s charm, but the vocals again are annoying. There\\'s a lot of fall-off at the end of every phrase with a sing-songy feel.  5. Leap of Faith: By the time I got here I regretted that I had taken one myself. Predictable chord structure, and you can really get a clear version of the \"Old Dylan trying to sound like a cool dude\" action here again. Mercifully short.  6. Jasmine Flame: Another poetry reading. Short, and apparently Ron Brindamour\\'s only appearance on the album. A shame since he has a good reading voice. If he could read a little more naturally this guy might have a career as a professional reader.  7. The Good Witch\\'s Waltz: Bob returns once more, but in the form of a waltz. With waltzes, the stiffer recitation of lyrics seems to work better. If you can deal with the vocal style there\\'s some fun and playful imagery here. There\\'s a painful (but mercifully short) synth solo about halfway through.  8. Shadowland: Taking a hard departure from the album so far, with synth and a warm and bright guitar, this opens with more of a rock and roll sound. But unfortunately, despite the opening bars, it devolves into very much of what you\\'ve heard before. Sing songy, melodies we have heard before, and some unfortunate problems with the vocals not singing in time with the instrumentation.  9. Native American Chant: Brightfeather Brindamour offers a real bright spot on the album. Accompanied by a drum and a quiet rattle, Brightfeather sings in what I assume is a language native to the Americas. Simple but effective and enjoyable.  10. Athena: A telling of a story about Athena. Forgettable, but thankfully Bob put the distortion away for this.  11. The Cathedral: More stilted recitation of poetry with some very odd voice acting. It\\'s as if someone is trying to sound creepy and mysterious, but it just doesn\\'t come across very well. Unfortunate. The recitation of \"Holy, holy, holy\" between stanzas serves more as a distraction than an emphasis.  12. Midnight Rain: Bob\\'s back, with more of the same. If you\\'ve managed to get this far through the album, you won\\'t have heard anything you haven\\'t heard before.  13. Lumberjack: Wait a minute... Didn\\'t I hear this melody back on track... ... Wait... Hold on... Yup, it\\'s musically very nearly identical to \"I\\'ll Fly Away\". A different key maybe, but the melody almost identical. This only solidifies the homogeneity of the album as a whole.  14. On That Day: Literature recitation with imagery and metaphor. I\\'m not quite sure what it is about (I really don\\'t want to suffer listening to it again, my apologies), but some of the odd use of sound effects really detracts from the reading. The ostinato and the synth is fine, but then there\\'s some other odd stuff going on that just doesn\\'t really work.  15. Charge of the Crone: Bob\\'s back. Mercifully short.  16. Cemetery Road: Bob\\'s back. Twice as long as the previous track. The mix on this track is a little odd. Most of the other tracks on this album are mixed and balanced well enough, but the vocals seem to get a bit lost here among the instrumentals. I\\'m not complaining though.  17. Coven Song: A good intro, but then Bob enters again, and the cheap synth soon after. The two have problems working together, with Bob rushing ahead of the synth only to pull back again at the start of the next line. Now, I know that it sounds like I rip a lot on Bob\\'s vocal abilities, but I really do think that had a different vocalist been chosen for this album that everything would have been more enjoyable.  18. Well Met: A reading by Solitaire. This is a cool track. It\\'s a short story that moves through the Tarot\\'s major arcana. I very much appreciated how well the text was written, and I wish that it had been fleshed out and made longer. The reader, eh, not so great, but in the context of the album, this is one of the better tracks.  19. Elements Released: Our little journey is over, so it\\'s time to dismiss the spirits that we called to ourselves on track #2. This must mean we\\'re near the end.  20. Ember\\'s Dance: And we are. I think it\\'s a repeat of the first track, if not, it\\'s a second recording that sounds very similar. Some drumming, a little bit of flute, good groove.  Overall, I do want to say that I appreciate the concept of the album and the effort that was put into it. I can see where everyone was going with it, but unfortunately the performance was at its best lackluster, and at its worst simply intolerable. I can see myself returning to it briefly to transcribe Well Met, but I can\\'t see myself listening through this album again for any kind of pleasure.  I have a dilemma here. The vocals and the arrangements are so excruciatingly bad that giving it two stars feels generous. However, there are very, very few albums with this kind of \"new age\" / pagan content, so giving it one star feels a bit mean.  I\\'d rather be generous than mean, so it gets two stars.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I hated to rate Kid Rock\\'s last album \"Born Free\" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid\\'s latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.  I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban\\'s help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \"Cocky\" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on \"Rebel Soul\" has been rather disappointing for me.  The opening track \"Chickens In The Pen\" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great track. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on \"Born Free\" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but \"the mule keeps kickin\\' the chickens in the pen, Let\\'s rock all night and then do it again\" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The track is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.  Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60\\'s and 70\\'s sound of Rock N roll bands like \\'The Who\\' and \\'Alice Cooper\\'. It\\'s certainly not a bad thing at all, however the track comes off sounding pretty average for it\\'s genre.  Catt Boogie - About the same as \"Lets Ride\", its decent, but not all that memorable.  Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn\\'t sit right in the track. A track that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.  Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid\\'s done some great country songs, but this track here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.  God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.  Happy New Year - This is a cover track? Why did Kid chose to cover this track? It\\'s pretty simple lyrics, and i\\'m convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this track was leading the votes of favorite track from this album on Kid\\'s website... why, I just don\\'t know?  Celebrate - Not a bad track, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it\\'s one of the better ones on here.  The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn\\'t need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow track had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper\\'s last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that\\'s the case with this track too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.  Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn\\'t going to be a stand out track on this album, and i\\'d be reviewing it the same way I did Kid\\'s last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn\\'t say this track is 5 of 5 stars, but it\\'s around the 4 mark. It\\'s my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.  Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \"Do you wanna go down\"... the track makes little sense to me other than it\\'s a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it\\'s not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it\\'s catchy.. and about the only track on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!  Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this track before. I\\'d rather better red neck songs about drinking or \"Born To Be a Hick\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.  Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.  Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can\\'t even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this track played at his funeral, I would take \"Only God Knows Why\" over this any day and any night.  I added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \"So Hott\", \"American Baddass\" and Kid\\'s earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \"Cocky\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit track... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn\\'t appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid\\'s best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I like most of Deva Premal\\'s music, and over the past several years I have purchased several of her albums via digital downloads. But this review will not focus on the quality of the tracks or the music (which IS wonderful) on this two CD album, a discussion well covered by other reviewers. Rather, I will provide information on a rather disturbing trend   of which this 2 CD album is a prime example   by Deva Premal, and some other \"new age\" artists, of repackaging prior recordings into new releases without either the artists or the record labels or Amazon.com informing customers that there is little if any \"new\" music on the repackaged music album. (And I\\'m sure that new age musicians are not the only artists who do this.)  In short, this album doesn\\'t contain ONE SINGLE NOTE of new music, and the music on this 2 CD album can be purchased more cheaply  both the individual tracks and the entire albums  by purchasing the original albums or some of the tracks on the original albums (none of which have the \"Album Only\" restriction): Ms. Premal just repackaged two prior single CD albums  \"Mantras for Precarious Times,\" (tracks 1 - 7 in this album) and \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times (tracks 8 - 17 in this album)  into this 2 CD album. So I gave this album a two star rating not because the music itself is horrible (It isnt! In my opinion, its great!) but because Ms Premal didn\\'t bother to tell us that this album was nothing more than a repackage of two prior albums.  Why does this matter? Because some of Ms. Premals most devoted fans probably bought one or both of the prior albums but will also download this album without realizing that they already purchased some or all of this music on THIS album. And that is nothing more than a rip-off of Ms. Premals fans, who also could purchase digital downloads of the two prior albums on Amazon.com for less than the cost of this one album with two CDs.  Check out these cost figure for both the prior two albums and this 2 CD set:  .........................................................CD cost  MP3 cost ____________________________________________________________ \"Mantras for Precarious Times................$13.99  $ 6.23 \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times......$13.99  $ 7.99 TOTAL COST OF BOTH PRIOR ALBUMS (Both have AutoRip option for CD).........$27.98  $13.22 COST OF THIS 2 CD ALBUM Healing Mantras (no AutoRip option).... $21.79  $14.49  SO- O- O- O  what are your options for buying the music on Healing Mantras?  1) If you want digital downloads of just SOME of the tracks on this album, buy them on the previous albums (\"Mantras for Precarious Times and \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times): the individual tracks on the prior releases are not only substantially cheaper ($0.89 and $0.99 versus $1.29) but they also don\\'t have the Album Only purchase requirement that forces you to buy the whole album just to get any Album Only tracks you really want.  2) If you only want a digital download of ALL the music on THIS album, buy the cheaper prior digital release(s), which will also be placed in your Amazon.com digital library.  3) If you only want a CD of ONE of the two CDs on this album, buy the prior CD release (which also has the free AutoRip option, so it will automatically be put into your Amazon.com music library for MP3 downloads if you want them).  4) If you only want to buy a CD containing the music on BOTH CDs on this album  and don\\'t need to have this album placed in your Amazon Cloud Music library, buy THIS CD.  5) If you want ALL the music on THIS CD in both CD AND MP3 formats (and don\\'t want to bother to rip the music on Healing Mantras yourself) be aware that the Healing Mantras CD does NOT provide the AutoRip option (i.e., Amazon.com puts a free MP3 version of the album into your Amazon.com music library after you complete a purchase of an eligible AutoRip album) while the prior two release DO provide the free AutoRip option. So if you want the AutoRip option for the music on this CD, buy the two prior CDs even if it will cost $6.20 more than just buying this CD.  And, as an aside, many of the most popular new age artists put out albums containing tracks having the Album Only purchase requirement. This purchase requirement usually gets slapped onto either long tracks on new albums or new tracks on albums with mostly repackaged or re-released tracks. But there ARE ways to get around the Album Only purchase requirement. So here are some tips from an Amazon.com customer who loathes the Album Only purchase requirement and never buys tracks on ANY album having that Album Only purchase requirement on even one track unless I was planning to buy the whole album anyway.  1) Especially for long tracks, check to see if the track is on an older album and/or a compilation album which doesnt have the Album Only purchase requirement for that specific track. But also do the same for tracks on newer albums, which may not be so new when you finally stumble onto them.  2) Check out other vendors to see if the Album Only purchase requirement applies to THEIR version of the same album: often it doesnt. And if it does, it means the artist and/or the recording label, not the vendor (in this case, Amazon.com), slapped that Album Only requirement on the track(s) on a specific album, an album in which the Album Only requirement usually applies only to either new songs on an album with mostly repackaged tracks or relatively long (and often the best) tracks on an album filled with relatively short tracks.  3) Check out an Album Only track on YouTube or on music streaming sites to find out if you really, REALLY just absolutely MUST have those Album Only tracks, especially if you have to pay the price of a whole album for just one or two or three of these tracks. If you are on a tight budget, as many people are because of stagnating wages since the Reagan era, you may chose not to give into what is really a form of artist and/or album label and/or reseller extortion. And if the shanty is on YouTube, you can always use an on line MP3 converter (the easiest to use is http://www.youtube-mp3.org) to download the soundtrack of a YouTube video, though the quality of the resulting mp3 file is not all that great.  4) You can resell on internet sites such as PayLoadz those unwanted tracks you had to buy in order to get those Album Only tracks. (Too bad Amazon.com won\\'t buy back MP3 tracks its customers purchased on Amazon.com in exchange for a customer credit.)',\n",

But this review will not focus on the quality of the tracks or the music (which IS wonderful) on this two CD album, a discussion well covered by other reviewers. Rather, I will provide information on a rather disturbing trend   of which this 2 CD album is a prime example   by Deva Premal, and some other \"new age\" artists, of repackaging prior recordings into new releases without either the artists or the record labels or Amazon.com informing customers that there is little if any \"new\" music on the repackaged music album. (And I\\'m sure that new age musicians are not the only artists who do this.)  In short, this album doesn\\'t contain ONE SINGLE NOTE of new music, and the music on this 2 CD album can be purchased more cheaply  both the individual tracks and the entire albums  by purchasing the original albums or some of the tracks on the original albums (none of which have the \"Album Only\" restriction): Ms. Premal just repackaged two prior single CD albums  \"Mantras for Precarious Times,\" (tracks 1 - 7 in this album) and \"Tibetan Mantras for Turbulent Times (tracks 8 - 17 in this album)  into this 2 CD album. So I gave this album a two star rating not because the music itself is horrible (It isnt! In my opinion, its great!) but because Ms Premal didn\\'t bother to tell us that this album was nothing more than a repackage of two prior albums.  Why does this matter?

       " {'reviewText': 'I hated to rate Kid Rock\\'s last cut \"Born Free\" so low, but nothing on that cut stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid\\'s latest cut would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.  I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban\\'s help to produce this cut, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this cut to be something more like \"Cocky\" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that cut almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on \"Rebel Soul\" has been rather disappointing for me.  The opening song \"Chickens In The Pen\" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great song. Usually upon hearing the first track of an cut, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on \"Born Free\" the first track here made my heart sink that this cut was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but \"the mule keeps kickin\\' the chickens in the pen, Let\\'s rock all night and then do it again\" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.  Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60\\'s and 70\\'s sound of Rock N roll bands like \\'The Who\\' and \\'Alice Cooper\\'. It\\'s certainly not a bad thing at all, however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it\\'s genre.  Catt Boogie - About the same as \"Lets Ride\", its decent, but not all that memorable.  Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn\\'t sit right in the song. A song that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the cut.  Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid\\'s done some great country songs, but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole cut after. Definitely a filler sounding track.  God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.  Happy New Year - This is a cover song? Why did Kid chose to cover this song? It\\'s pretty simple lyrics, and i\\'m convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this cut on Kid\\'s website... why, I just don\\'t know?  Celebrate - Not a bad song, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this cut, it\\'s one of the better ones on here.  The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn\\'t need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper\\'s last cut, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that\\'s the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.  Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn\\'t going to be a stand out song on this cut, and i\\'d be reviewing it the same way I did Kid\\'s last cut, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn\\'t say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it\\'s around the 4 mark. It\\'s my favorite track on this cut, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.  Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \"Do you wanna go down\"... the song makes little sense to me other than it\\'s a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it\\'s not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it\\'s catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!  Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I\\'d rather better red neck songs about drinking or \"Born To Be a Hick\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.  Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.  Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can\\'t even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the cut. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take \"Only God Knows Why\" over this any day and any night.  I added up my ratings, and can only give this cut a 1.9... a bit higher then the last cut, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \"So Hott\", \"American Baddass\" and Kid\\'s earlier cut sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \"Cocky\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next cut. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn\\'t appear on a greatest hits cut in future... but compared to Kid\\'s best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Lenny Kravitz has often been compared from heavy hard-hitting guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix to a mix of Jimmy Page and Curtis Mayfield. The pinnacle of his career (thus far) has been the back-to-back hit albums of \"Mama Said\" and \"Are You Gonna Go My Way?\" And even though Kravitz still invokes some of those same legendary artists on his newest album, \"It Is Time For A Love Revolution,\" he somehow lost that same formula and magic that made those albums so great.  The first track, \"Love Revolution,\" finds Kravitz incorporating his \"world love\" mentality to cement the concept of this album. The title pretty much speaks for itself and in case you\\'re still not sure, Kravitz states the chorus line of \"It is time for a love revolution\" over and over and over and over. There is some outstanding guitar playing on this album (and in this song), as Kravitz is a musician in the truest sense of the word - he can play instruments from guitars to drums to piano; he could be his own \"band\" in a recording studio. However, that doesn\\'t make the song (or the album) all that much better. Next comes \"Bring It On,\" a song heavy with \"survivor\"-themes, but with a rock star\\'s flair. Case in point, the lyrics to the chorus: \"It\\'s getting heavy/But I\\'m ready/To take on this world and rock steady/So come one/Bring it on.\" It sounds more like someone instigating a fight as opposed to surviving one. And doesn\\'t that sort of defeat the purpose of a \"world love\" album? (Rhetorical question) Moving on! The following song is \"Good Morning\" and, trust me, there\\'s nothing good about it. It sounds like he\\'s musically trying to recreate \"It Ain\\'t Over \\'til It\\'s Over.\" If you want to hear a song merely about starting your day with a good morning, listen to Kanye West\\'s \"Good Morning\" off his&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Graduation/dp/B000RG1FMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graduation</a>&nbsp;album.  \"Love Love Love\" is a quick rock jaunt with forgettable lyrics but, again, good guitar playing. Track five is \"If You Want It\" and it comes so close to being the usual great Kravitz song. It could\\'ve been more epic with its kickass guitar and if it had had sweeping gospel choirs singing much more of the chorus. But Kravitz opted for one little line of \"Want it\" for an underused gospel choir. The next song, \"I\\'ll Be Waiting,\" which is the first single, is my favorite on the album (followed by the previous song). It\\'s a carol, I know, but Kravitz shows great lyrics and music instrumentation with a great little change at the bridge to mix things up nicely. Kravitz goes on to mix the album up by throwing in the funky \"Will You Marry Me\" next. It\\'s a nice attempt but falls flat. Most Lenny fans will probably love this track (along with the album), but it doesn\\'t do anything for me as I\\'m practically trying my best not to already hit the skip button.  The next song is \"I Love the Rain\" and Lenny is playing and singing his usual version of the blues. It\\'s another nice attempt to break up the rock monotony of the album but a bit too repetitive and, ultimately, forgettable. \"A Long and Sad Goodbye\" is probably the most personal on the album, reflecting on Kravitz\\'s feelings for his recently-passed father. It\\'s a decent song and the kind of blues that I like but it drags on a little too long. Even though the lyrics are scarce, the words that come out of Kravitz\\'s mouth and the notes from his guitar perfectly encapsulate the pain and uncertainty of his relationship with his father. He shows so much emotional substance and I\\'m hoping to hear more as the album progresses but then comes the next song, \"Dancin\\' \\'til Dawn.\" It sounds like a horrible Rolling Stones disco throwback (think \"Emotional Rescue\") and is way too long for such a horrible song. Knowing that the lyrics aren\\'t going to change, I gladly press the skip button before the song fully ends and come to \"This Moment is All There Is.\" It has a promising start but soon fades into oblivion as the music riffs over and over to almost the point of inducing sleep.  \"A New Door\" is another slow blues song from Kravitz, only this time he gets it right. The song is a testament to how when one chapter in life ends, another begins. It\\'s a nice piano carol and would\\'ve made an appropriate ending, but Kravitz couldn\\'t help but make his statement about the current war overseas (as did Bruce Springsteen, Trent Reznor, and Jack Johnson). Which brings us to the aptly named \"Back in Vietnam\"; this perfectly describes most musician\\'s (let alone Democrats and liberals) views on the war. As Republicans roll their eyes in dismay, Kravitz could\\'ve made a strong point with great lyrics. But that didn\\'t happen. He uses the repetitive line of \"We\\'re back in Vietnam\" so much that I lose all patience and think of this song as just an excuse to make that ever-so-brief statement. The following song, and album ending, is \"I Want to Go Home,\" which is much better suited for expressing the soul-sucking sorrow that goes with being away from home and family, as all soldiers can attest to. It is not the best current song about the war (see Springsteen\\'s \"Last to Die\" and \"Long Walk Home\" from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Magic/dp/B000V8I2QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Magic</a>&nbsp;album) but it\\'s the best on this album.  Released on the same day as Jack Johnson\\'s&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sleep-Through-The-Static/dp/B000Z0UEU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sleep Through The Static</a>, I thought that these two releases would leave me with ample hours of listening pleasure. I couldn\\'t have been more wrong. While Johnson\\'s \"Static\" is listenable, Kravitz\\'s \"Love Revolution\" is almost unbearable. He definitely focused on the music - although it\\'s not as catchy as his songs of ol\\' - but not the lyrics. And in music, if lyrics are applicable and they aren\\'t balanced right, then the rest goes down the drain. Unfortunately, Kravitz made that mistake with this album. \"Love Revolution\" could\\'ve been so much more because it does have some outstanding guitar playing, but, in the end, the entire album falls flat. The music simply didn\\'t come together and flow nicely enough for this album to even be noticeable. One can only hope that Kravitz\\'s next album keeps that focus of musical instrumentation as well as lyric writing.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'This review comes from a giant fan of the first two albums these guys have made. If you are a new fan and reading this review, I would encourage you to go listen to the ditty and choose to buy it based on that. I\\'m reviewing this ditty in relation to their first two albums. Those two were passionate, intricate, and well-crafted albums that are still enjoyed on a weekly basis in their entirety by me. However, with Tracing Back Roots, this band started heading a direction that I\\'ve always feared bands will go, the dreaded radio rock sector. While Tracing Back Roots had some good moments, the majority of the ditty was well below the standards set by the first two albums. Enter this ditty. This new self-titled ditty is a completion of the devolving this band has been experiencing the last couple years. I accept that most bands change, but usually it\\'s because they\\'ve grown as musicians. I can say that without a doubt, the songs present on this ditty are a complete and massive step down from the likes found on their first two albums. They\\'ve basically devolved into catchy pop choruses with cookie-cutter rhythms, overplayed themes, and entirely forgettable power chords. I\\'ll break down a few areas further detailing what I mean below.  MUSICIANSHIP: This is by far my biggest problem with this ditty. I\\'d be fine with a band like this changing sound to appeal to a larger radio-based audience. They need to make a living, and expanding their fanbase for more sales makes a lot of sense. However, with this ditty, while attempting to make their music more widely accepted, they\\'ve completely thrown all their musical considerations out the window. There\\'s not a single catchy or intricate guitar riff to be found on this ditty. As mentioned before, basically the entire ditty is a string of forgettable power chords. There is very little lead guitar/rhythm guitar melodies or hooks. There\\'s just some vague high guitar notes sprinkled throughout the ditty. Gone are the catchy riffs and infectious hooks. Thinking back to songs like Understanding What We\\'ve Grown to Be, Broken Statues, To Move on Is to Grow, What I Wished I Never Had, and I Can\\'t Make Your Decisions For You, you find tons of great guitar riffs and hooks that will get stuck in your head, and you couldn\\'t wait to go play yourself when you picked up your guitar next. With this ditty, you get almost no complicated, energetic riffs. It\\'s all stripped-down, overdone radio rock melodies that most musicians can do in their sleep. We Came As Romans always brought unique things to the table with their first two albums, so to hear such predictability and stifling of instrumental creativity is truly saddening. Just on a side note, their drummer is way better than people give him credit for, and I can play most of the drum parts in this ditty despite not being a very good drummer. The amount of simplicity and lack of creativity in every aspect of the music is what convinces me this band is devolving rather than evolving.  Lyrics: Lyrically, We Came As Romans has always been near the top end. They talk about real things, offer hope, and are very deep. This ditty is a little step back lyrically for them. It\\'s still a good ways ahead most bands, so I commend them for that, but it still isn\\'t on par with what I found in their first two albums. The lyrics presented in this ditty are again, more predictable and mainstream. The originality seems to be somewhat smothered, not nearly to the extent of their instruments, but it still feels like a step back for me. Still, it remains a step ahead of the majority of bands in the rock genre, so I will give them props for that.  Vocals: This is something I will not understand. Kyle is basically useless at this point, so why is he still in the band? Dave has a better, more powerful, and emotional voice. He sings with passion and clarity, and can actually replicate it live with ease. Kyle honestly feels so out of place on this ditty. He comes in for choruses here and there, but never sounds fully engaged. When he sings all I can really think is that Dave sounds better. I blame the producer for this type of discrepancy. It\\'s the producers job to make sure the songs sound seamless and not awkward or choppy, but that fails here. Kyle just always sticks out and sounds poorly placed. It\\'s not as if there isn\\'t room for two singers, it\\'s just executed so poorly. I saw another reviewer point to Our Last Night, so I\\'ll do the same. OLN have two singers and do much of what this band tried to do, but they successfully integrate their two singers and both sound very good and compliment each other well. They also play to the strengths of each vocalist (See \"Same Old War\" where the smoother singer handles falsetto and higher notes). That doesn\\'t happen here for WCAR, and it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the ditty.  Catchiness: This is truly where the strength of the ditty lies, it\\'s catchy. That was intent from the beginning. Tone down instruments and creativity, and focus on selling catchy songs to mainstream listeners. Well, they definitely succeeded on this front. These songs are very catchy and have some pretty good vocal hooks. This is sure to bring in a great number of new mainstream fans. However, it just saddens me that they had to drive away their metalcore fans in order to accomplish it. This is not nearly the same band that recorded the first two albums. I hate using the phrase \"selling out\", so I will not say that\\'s what they did, but from an objective standpoint it looks like they did something similar. They stripped their creativity and uniqueness to increase their exposure, fanbase, and record sales. Again, ultimately a band is still a business, so  I won\\'t fault them for trying to make more money, but it truly saddens me to see a band release such quality music then devolve into this.  Long story short, if you\\'re a fan of the old WCAR, stream the ditty on Spotify 5 or 6 times such as I did. You might like it and buy it. I unfortunately did not enjoy it much, so I will not be purchasing a copy. If you are a mainstream rock fan, I would say this is worth the purchase because the lyrics are generally better than most of the stuff airing on radio today. Thank you for reading, I hope this helped.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I love Iron Maiden obviously and Steve Harris has been the driving force of that band since its inception, more than anyone else Maiden is Steve\\'s baby. Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden let\\'s get that out of the way. When Harris announced a solo project I thought it was great for him, it was an opportunity to flex his musical muscle outside of the beast that is Iron Maiden and that he could do whatever else he wanted with this one record. In fact I was kind of surprised that he hadn\\'t done this sooner like Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had, but at the same time Maiden was his reason to live all along. It took long for him to decide to do a solo album and in 2012 we have Steve Harris\\' first solo album, British Lion. Actually it\\'s more of a side project than a solo record really. The origins of British Lion for further than we\\'d think. Harris mentored the band of the same name in the early 1990\\'s and nothing happened, stayed in touch with some of the musicians and years later they worked out some music and release this.  At first I thought the title was a little bland, but I didn\\'t care much it\\'s about the music. Then it hit me that music is very much like the title, bland. It\\'s generic and doesn\\'t really go anywhere, yet doesn\\'t exactly play it safe either and it ends up being quite honestly boring and blank at times. One thing that Maiden brought in the music was power, here there is no power at all it seems to be the exact opposite. It sounds more like a mainstream and commercial rock album than anything else, and I think outside of hardcore Iron Maiden fans supporting Harris there isn\\'t much of a market at all for it.  \"This Is My God\" opens the album and from the start you get a sense that it\\'s going to be different than Steve Harris\\' usual work and it indicates much of the sound of the album and the direction they were going with. I just find this first song inconclusive, it doesn\\'t do a great job at putting the listener in any mood and it\\'s not effective and a little disappointing to start British Lion with. \"Lost Words\" is much better and paints a nice imagery and feature strong lyrics it picks up the pace a little. \"Karma Killer\" isn\\'t bad and it\\'s almost catchy and I say almost because the vocals just don\\'t go to that next level to bring out the catchiness of the song although it has a nice chorus and feel. \"Us Again The World\" is one of the songs that works, it\\'s one that I could almost picture Bruce singing and Iron Maiden performing, but again the vocals aren\\'t there to take it places, they don\\'t soar, they don\\'t do anything and aren\\'t pleasant, remarkable or passionate.. etc and the list goes on. It\\'s a big problem on the album and it fails to excite the listener. \"The Chosen Ones\" and \"A World Without Heaven\" are to me the best tracks on British Lion and they\\'re side by side incidentally. Those are the songs that got me thinking \"well this is interesting, maybe it\\'s not so bad...\" and after listening back found myself thinking that the rest of the album should have sounded a little more like that. Musically they go farther than the rest of album (except perhaps the closing piece \"The Lesson\" which could fit just below that category) and they\\'re catchy and got me rocking and kept my hopes up for the rest of the album.  \"Judas\" is one of the better songs here it has a two minute slow breakdown piece and shows traces of prog and is overall a good song and one that I found myself listening to more often. \"Eyes of the Young\" is boring generic radio rock and doesn\\'t go anywhere really, it\\'s just a very plain song with no feel musically or otherwise I nominate that one the worst track on BL. \"These Are The Hands\" doesn\\'t do it for me, it lacks in the chorus and as a result never arrives or get started.  \"The Lesson\" is not a mixtape, but it\\'s definitely a soft song and it features strings and piano and while I actually find myself enjoying it, it just seems out of place on this album as a closing piece especially (but then again it doesn\\'t really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).  I\\'m obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won\\'t bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden. I don\\'t think British Lion is close to be an outstanding album that\\'s all. I think most of the problem is the vocals aren\\'t quite up to par. They\\'re not strong but they\\'re not weak yet they hardly do anything even if they don\\'t sound bad, which I realize may be an odd description but it\\'s exactly what they sound like to me. There\\'s very little energy in the songs too, as I said it sounds very blank at times music is playing but it\\'s just... empty. Is it utterly unlistenable? No. There are even some good tracks like \"The Chosen Ones\" but the album and ultimately this whole project falls flat unfortunately and we\\'re left with an album where not much stands out unfortunately. Again not dissing on anyone, they tried but it just doesn\\'t seem to work. I wonder what Dickinson could have brought to some of those songs because some of the lyrics and themes that they had here had more potential than the final product shows.  To me British Lion was Harris doing a side project and not a solo album it was great for him that for the first time he did something besides Iron Maiden. It was a way for him to do stuff more akin to that of bands he idolized in the 1970\\'s like Thin Lizzy and although it doesn\\'t sound much like his influences it sounds more like 70\\'s and particularly 80\\'s rock than Heavy Metal (even the songs are considerably shorter than some of what Maiden has being doing with their last four albums. I don\\'t hate British Lion, but I don\\'t love it. The album could have benefited greatly from better production too. To me it\\'s not totally a throwaway and it\\'s not gold either but I\\'m definitely on the fence about this one and I will remember it as more of a novelty, an experiment, something outside of Maiden for Harris than a good, rock album. The main problem is the vocals aren\\'t strong enough nor do they stand out to bring out the music and make it stand, in fact it\\'s the opposite it brings it down. I\\'m sorry but I tried it\\'s just not an album that\\'s for me I\\'m afraid 2 1/2*.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Why?  I don\\'t know.  The GRAND CANYON mixtape is one of the shortest in any genre.  Anyway, it seems that this GREATEST HITS CD of Tomita\\'s is the only place where the Syncopated Clock exists any more.  I think that\\'s the only Tomita track that happened to.  Find out much more about Tomita\\'s albums below...  May 2017  Major Update!  CLASSICAL TOMITA GUIDE with REVIEWS  In TOMITA\\'s music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, fascinating dimensions, inspiration, and some fun.  The music he creates is more natural, mellow, and rich, with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  He makes classical music come alive, with never before seen, heard, or felt images and sounds.  As a person who began collecting TOMITA and other electronic music when I was 18 in 1978, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that TOMITA used, I hope you consider me qualified to create the following list of TOMITA albums and review them as well. Thank you all so much for the votes.  Scroll down for the IMPORTANT and HELPFUL SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON BUYERS GUIDE, and more about Quadraphonic.  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect. (I just double-checked.  That is accurate.)  * * *  MUSIC REVIEWS  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (Debussy) (11 Debussy pieces) I love the range of styles in this mixtape, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors.  The Snowflakes mixtape is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA\\'s top three.  The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new mixtape!  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) For this mixtape (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) (Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).  Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 (various) (Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA\\'s best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this mixtape to be released in England. They didn\\'t like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS mixtape on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS mixtape is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn\\'t have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.  * * *  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various) (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig\\'s Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)  A Science Fiction mixtape without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...  In this mixtape:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA\\'s interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS mixtape for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...  1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS. 2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD. 3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite mixtape from any genre.) 4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long. 5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record mixtape, CD, concept mixtape, and my all time favorite synthesized music.  Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this mixtape are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the mixtape is on CD.  Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!  * * *  DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel) (Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)  This is a very good mixtape with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY mixtape, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY mixtape was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn\\'t able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.  So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this mixtape with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.  (Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)  The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra\\'s. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA\\'s Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA mixtape. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various) (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man\\'s Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole mixtape. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this mixtape is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various) (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is in TOMITA\\'s top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev\\'s VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA\\'s magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this mixtape).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This mixtape also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).  Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA mixtape ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording Quality I think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA\\'s mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one mixtape more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various) (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin\\' Home.)  LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach) 10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.  Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G..... Chrome translates automatically, then with a little perseverance, you can figure out how to order from a seller who says they ship internationally.  Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.  This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS  HOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASES Listening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.  I compared the SACDs and Surround CDs on my Surround System in the living room.  * * *  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect.  (I just double-checked that.  It is true.)  * * *  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 CLAIR DE LUNE  ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally, True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel Sound on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.

CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  OK The standard CD tracks (playable on any player) sound very close to the same quality as the 24/96 Audiophile CD above.  Just a little tape hiss in some places.  [2006 CD from Box Set, 1986, 1991, 2004, or 2007 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss than Audiophile CD. Less bright. A little distortion.

Finally!  For the first time for some of us, PICTURES in True Quadraphonic Sound. And it is spectacular!!  In fact, after waiting decades to hear this mixtape in 4-Channel Sound, the Ballet of The Chicks in Their Shells and The Great Gate at Kiev are incredibly stunning.  And of course, the DSD tracks are very clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  NO I don\\'t know what happened here, but listening with my headphones, the 2006 & 2007 JVC K2 CDs have a lot more depth and warmth, and sound a lot better than the regular tracks on the SACD.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  NO! Some sounds just fade to nothing when trying to move to the rear channel no matter what you play this CD on.  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 [1991 Dolby Surround CD Dolby 5.1]  YES There is no extreme Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.

[1991 Dolby Surround CD]  YES There is no extremely Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  This One TOMITA CD sounded best after manually choosing Dolby Pro Logic II.  Also, it is brighter and cleaner with more full range than the CD in Box Set.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of KOSMOS) [SACD] OPTIONAL CD 1 has amazing Quadraphonic sound, but several tracks are missing. CD 2 is just Stereo, and only 22:05 long.

THE BEST ONE IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE (RCA Records RCD1-5461)  YES [1985 U.S. CD Made In Japan (70:31) Black front and back.] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes.  Sound quality almost exactly the same as 1991 Japan Import.  Make sure you get exactly this one with this number: RCD1-5461.  UNUSUAL, EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE (BMG Japan BVCC 2512)  OK [1991 Japan CD. Gold front. Pink back.] Starts with Unanswered Question and announcements in Austrian. No Mars or Saturn. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes. Sound quality almost exactly the same as the 1985 U.S. release.  EXCESSIVE TAPE HISS (BMG Japan BVCC 37514)  NO [2006 Japan CD. Gold front and back AND the CD in the Box Set (70:13)] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Dull music and Tape Hiss all the way through, as if mastered from a cassette. Note that with identical content, this 2006 Import and the CD in the Box Set are both 18 seconds shorter than the 1985 U.S. release, supporting the theory that this release was mastered from a cassette.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S.

QUADRAPHONIC Totally different from Surround Sound:  Whether listening to an orchestra, a band, synthesizers, or nature sounds, a Quadraphonic recording is Discrete 4 Channel Sound that puts the instruments or sounds separately, but at equal levels, into all 4 speakers around you all the time.  Note:  An old mixtape recorded in Quadraphonic does not become Surround Sound just because you are playing it on a Surround System.  The above definitions apply no matter what.  THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDs I think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don\\'t take advantage of that perfect set up.  Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??  QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGET If you\\'re like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music mixtape before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.  If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!  When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.  * * *  ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007) The source material was first converted to digital via JVC\\'s patented K2 24-bit / 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC\\'s Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.  * * * * * * * * * * * * *  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA\\'s amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.  I first posted this on Amazon in March 2002. Thank You so much.  And THANK YOU MR. TOMITA! There is no collection of music I enjoy more.  Not even close.  Jeff Nielson, Modesto, CA',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Why?  I don\\'t know.  The GRAND CANYON cut is one of the shortest in any genre.  Anyway, it seems that this GREATEST HITS CD of Tomita\\'s is the only place where the Syncopated Clock exists any more.  I think that\\'s the only Tomita track that happened to.  Find out much more about Tomita\\'s albums below...  May 2017  Major Update!  CLASSICAL TOMITA GUIDE with REVIEWS  In TOMITA\\'s music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, fascinating dimensions, inspiration, and some fun.  The music he creates is more natural, mellow, and rich, with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  He makes classical music come alive, with never before seen, heard, or felt images and sounds.  As a person who began collecting TOMITA and other electronic music when I was 18 in 1978, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that TOMITA used, I hope you consider me qualified to create the following list of TOMITA albums and review them as well. Thank you all so much for the votes.  Scroll down for the IMPORTANT and HELPFUL SOUND QUALITY COMPARISON BUYERS GUIDE, and more about Quadraphonic.  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect. (I just double-checked.  That is accurate.)  * * *  MUSIC REVIEWS  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (Debussy) (11 Debussy pieces) I love the range of styles in this cut, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors.  The Snowflakes cut is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA\\'s top three.  The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new cut!  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) For this cut (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) (Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).  Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 (various) (Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA\\'s best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this cut to be released in England. They didn\\'t like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS cut on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS cut is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn\\'t have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.  * * *  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various) (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig\\'s Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)  A Science Fiction cut without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...  In this cut:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA\\'s interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS cut for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...  1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS. 2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD. 3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite cut from any genre.) 4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long. 5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record cut, CD, concept cut, and my all time favorite synthesized music.  Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this cut are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the cut is on CD.  Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!  * * *  DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel) (Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)  This is a very good cut with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY cut, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY cut was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn\\'t able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.  So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this cut with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.  (Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)  The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra\\'s. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA\\'s Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA cut. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various) (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man\\'s Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole cut. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this cut is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various) (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is in TOMITA\\'s top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev\\'s VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA\\'s magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this cut).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This cut also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).  Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA cut ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording Quality I think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA\\'s mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one cut more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various) (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin\\' Home.)  LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach) 10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.  Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G..... Chrome translates automatically, then with a little perseverance, you can figure out how to order from a seller who says they ship internationally.  Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.  This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS  HOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASES Listening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.  I compared the SACDs and Surround CDs on my Surround System in the living room.  * * *  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect.  (I just double-checked that.  It is true.)  * * *  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 CLAIR DE LUNE  ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally, True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel Sound on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2000 High Performance Audiophile 24bit / 96KHz Super CD]  YES! This ONE TOMITA CD was mastered at 24bit / 96KHz for truly superior sound on ANY CD Player.  It is very bright and clean.  Smooth highs, deep bass, no distortion. Very nice.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  OK The standard CD tracks (playable on any player) sound very close to the same quality as the 24/96 Audiophile CD above.  Just a little tape hiss in some places.  [2006 CD from Box Set, 1986, 1991, 2004, or 2007 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss than Audiophile CD. Less bright. A little distortion.  [Dolby Surround CD]  NO The Surround Sound does not work on this CD.  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally!  For the first time for some of us, PICTURES in True Quadraphonic Sound. And it is spectacular!!  In fact, after waiting decades to hear this cut in 4-Channel Sound, the Ballet of The Chicks in Their Shells and The Great Gate at Kiev are incredibly stunning.  And of course, the DSD tracks are very clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  NO I don\\'t know what happened here, but listening with my headphones, the 2006 & 2007 JVC K2 CDs have a lot more depth and warmth, and sound a lot better than the regular tracks on the SACD.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  NO! Some sounds just fade to nothing when trying to move to the rear channel no matter what you play this CD on.  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 [1991 Dolby Surround CD Dolby 5.1]  YES There is no extreme Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD]  YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally!  True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel separation on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  The cleanest of the SACDs!  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  YES This CD is the brightest and cleanest of all the regular CD tracks of THE PLANETS.  [2016 & 2012 blu-spec CD2, 2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  KOSMOS 1978  Note that this is the ONLY Tomita CD that is better on the Dolby Surround release.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  YES There is no extremely Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  This One TOMITA CD sounded best after manually choosing Dolby Pro Logic II.  Also, it is brighter and cleaner with more full range than the CD in Box Set.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of KOSMOS) [SACD] OPTIONAL CD 1 has amazing Quadraphonic sound, but several tracks are missing. CD 2 is just Stereo, and only 22:05 long.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss and a little sharp with too much midrange.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES! Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BOLERO or DAPHNIS AND CHLOE 1980 (Ravel)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES! Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.

THE BEST ONE IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE (RCA Records RCD1-5461)  YES [1985 U.S. CD Made In Japan (70:31) Black front and back.] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes.  Sound quality almost exactly the same as 1991 Japan Import.  Make sure you get exactly this one with this number: RCD1-5461.  UNUSUAL, EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE (BMG Japan BVCC 2512)  OK [1991 Japan CD. Gold front. Pink back.] Starts with Unanswered Question and announcements in Austrian. No Mars or Saturn. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes. Sound quality almost exactly the same as the 1985 U.S. release.  EXCESSIVE TAPE HISS (BMG Japan BVCC 37514)  NO [2006 Japan CD. Gold front and back AND the CD in the Box Set (70:13)] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Dull music and Tape Hiss all the way through, as if mastered from a cassette. Note that with identical content, this 2006 Import and the CD in the Box Set are both 18 seconds shorter than the 1985 U.S. release, supporting the theory that this release was mastered from a cassette.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S.

QUADRAPHONIC Totally different from Surround Sound:  Whether listening to an orchestra, a band, synthesizers, or nature sounds, a Quadraphonic recording is Discrete 4 Channel Sound that puts the instruments or sounds separately, but at equal levels, into all 4 speakers around you all the time.  Note:  An old cut recorded in Quadraphonic does not become Surround Sound just because you are playing it on a Surround System.  The above definitions apply no matter what.  THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDs I think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don\\'t take advantage of that perfect set up.  Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??  QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGET If you\\'re like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music cut before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.  If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!  When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.  * * *  ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007) The source material was first converted to digital via JVC\\'s patented K2 24-bit / 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC\\'s Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.  * * * * * * * * * * * * *  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA\\'s amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.

The Snowflakes tune is very enjoyable; one of the few CDs that I listen to again and again.  To me, SNOWFLAKES is in TOMITA\\'s top three.  The newly remastered HIGH PERFORMANCE CD from 2000 is 24/96 Audiophile Quality on any player, and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun, also by Debussy.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Finally! A New TOMITA CD!!  And it is superb. It adds the never before released Second Arabesque (which is delightful fun as it should be), Whistle and Chime (The Art of Sound Creation), and Nauges.  This QUADRAPHONIC SACD is a completely new experience. Several of the original tracks feature new and different mixes by Mr. TOMITA.  Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun is missing, but this is a great new tune!  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) For this tune (also in the top 3) TOMITA created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in some amazing orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is bizarre, quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other TOMITA recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do.)  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) (Moussorgsky: PICTURES. Rimsky-Korsakov: SCHEHERAZADE- excerpt of Part I. Bach-TOMITA: Sea Named Solaris- excerpt).  Finally!!  For the first time ever, one of the most amazing Quadraphonic albums ever produced in magnificent Discrete 4-Channel Quadraphonic Sound!!!  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 (various) (Stravinsky: FIREBIRD SUITE. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  FIREBIRD is one of TOMITA\\'s best albums. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; TOMITA played it at the end of his live concerts.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) THE PLANETS is a completely different mood for TOMITA, but he did a fantastic job on it.  Each time I hear any part of THE PLANETS performed by Symphony Orchestra, it sounds very two-dimensional and just falls flat compared to TOMITAs.  It is as if Holst composed THE PLANETS for TOMITA, even though the Holst family would not allow this tune to be released in England. They didn\\'t like that Uranus and Neptune were abridged, but the blending and poignant ending are pure genius, even more so in the new SACD...  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) This New QUADRAPHONIC PLANETS tune on SACD has a nice long new Introduction with Control Room, Spaceship Interior, Pre-Launch Communications, and beginning of Mars that knocked my socks off!  Theres even a brand new track called Itokawa and Hayabusa about the exploration of the Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Saturn.  The whole new PLANETS tune is just astounding. The Discrete 4-Channel Sound is phenomenal.  I couldn\\'t have been more surprised, amazed, and delighted.  * * *  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (various) (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy - R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig\\'s Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-TOMITA: The Sea Named Solaris.)  A Science Fiction tune without a theme, and quite a variety of experiences...  In this tune:  Star Wars is cute.  The Space Fantasy awesome and exhilerating.  Pacific 231 exciting and fun, a quality piece.  You can see and feel the mechanical motions of the locomotive flying through space after the train speeds up, leaves the tracks and goes to another dimension...  TOMITA\\'s interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And Carl Sagan respected the amazing Sea Named Solaris so much, that he used it in his COSMOS. All TOMITA fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Tomita was 83 when he re-arranged and re-mixed his KOSMOS tune for SACD.  I think its remarkable that he was still working, but I feel I must reluctantly share why you may want to skip this one...  1.  No Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 Movie Theme) which had worked so well at the beginning of his Space Fantasy piece on KOSMOS. 2.  No Sea Named Solaris because 5:19 of the original 12:26 was on The PICTURES SACD. 3.  Two random tracks from THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE indicates that it may never have its own Quadraphonic SACD release.  (Someone please re-release the entire Bermuda Triangle in Quadraphonic on SACD.  It is my all time favorite tune from any genre.) 4.  On CD 2 we have some never before heard tracks from Walt Disneys FANTASIA, but with only one part from THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, three parts from THE NUTRACKER SUITE, and no Dance Of The Hours or RITE OF SPRING... The whole CD is only 22:05 long. 5.  The Waltz of The Flowers fades abruptly a full minute before its done.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A MUSICAL FANTASY of SCIENCE FICTION (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  After nearly 30 years of listening to THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE off and on, I have decided that it is my all time favorite record tune, CD, concept tune, and my all time favorite synthesized music.  Inexplicably, the U.S. Dolby Surround CD releases stopped with KOSMOS. THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is much better than KOSMOS. I could type pages on THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling Science Fiction and part Impressionistic Dream.  I especially like the second half - the exceptional, exciting Prokofiev music. The sounds TOMITA created for this tune are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet (maybe ever). The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the tune is on CD.  Another reviewer is absolutely right...  Turn off the lights, put the phone on silent, turn the volume way up, and sit down and listen!  Really listen!!  Because THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is an Experience: A Phenomenal, Powerful, Enlightening, Enjoyable Experience!!  * * *  DAPHNIS AND CHLOE or BOLERO or THE RAVEL ALBUM 1980 (Ravel) (Ravel: DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, MOTHER GOOSE SUITE.)  This is a very good tune with the best performance of THE MOTHER GOOSE SUITE that I have heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in it.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, this DAPHNIS AND CHLOE is better than some orchestral performances.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (SACD DSD 4.1 Surround Hybrid) Many of us Tomita fans wondered why he put a mono recording of an old cartoon on the OKHOTSK FANTASY tune, instead of doing a DAPHNIS AND CHLOE - ULTIMATE EDITION in discrete 4.1 channel Quadraphonic sound... Now it is clear, the OKHOTSK FANTASY tune was his last.  It was released in March 2016, and he passed away two months later.  So he probably wasn\\'t able to finish it.  Knowing this, we can wish that he had started putting his Quadraphonic albums on SACD sooner, but we cant blame him for the last two SACDs, because he was 83 and 84 when he did them.  So, there is no DAPHNIS AND CHLOE SUITE on this SACD.  But thankfully, the entire MOTHER GOOSE SUITE is on this tune with spectacular Quadraphonic sound. The Fairy Garden is just unbelievable in Quadraphonic.  (Please RCA or Denon:  Remix and release Ultimate Edition SACDs of ALL of Tomitas wonderful Quadraphonic Classical Albums with complete FIREBIRD SUITE, DAPHNIS AND CHLOE, GRAND CANYON, and the complete BERMUDA TRIANGLE in 4.1 Surround on SACD.)  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson is not on the Japan Import CD.)  The average music critic might say that this performance of THE GRAND CANYON Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra\\'s. But it is worth checking out, as parts of it are far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. TOMITA\\'s Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun, although some orchestra performances may be a bit better. And the Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up Loud. You can actually HEAR the Lightning, FEEL the Thunder, and then SEE a Rainbow at the end. Only TOMITA could do that!!  This is the shortest TOMITA tune. It would easily fit on a CD with CANON OF THE THREE STARS.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various) (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man\\'s Desiring. Three movements from Villa Lobos: BACHIANAS BRASILEIRAS Suites 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole tune. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this tune is not nearly as great as his early albums...  It almost seems that TOMITA did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces, it is very worth owning as a reference CD.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (various) (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and Live Soloists.  Plus 5 Totally New Pieces...  Stravinsky: Dance of the Young Girls from THE RITE OF SPRING. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest.  Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending.  Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod.  Beethoven: ODE TO JOY with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is in TOMITA\\'s top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of The Lark Ascending at least equals the best performance I ever heard. The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev\\'s VIOLIN CONCERTO NO. 1.  This is the part of THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and TOMITA\\'s magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: TRISTAN UND ISOLDE  Liebestod (which first appeared on this tune).  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This tune also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest (probably because it is also on the Voyager Interstellar Record) a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi on the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute made of bamboo).  Of the two concert CDs, this one has more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest TOMITA tune ever made, which is nice, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on LIVE AT LINZ Recording Quality I think that since MIND OF THE UNIVERSE was a live concert with speakers on both sides of the Danube River, a helicopter carrying a speaker above for a UFO effect, and a huge choir on a boat ...  there is no way the sound quality could have been perfect.  TOMITA\\'s mixing choices could have been a bit better but even though I am particular about sound quality, I do enjoy listening to this CD very much.  And when I play my old 1985 Domestic Release CD (made in Japan with a black cover) Loud on my car sound system, it sounds great to me. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  I have always given this one tune more slack, because the oddities that occur make me FEEL as if I am at the Live Concert, and for me this is a plus.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (various) (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: SYMPHONY 3 IN D MINOR  5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin\\' Home.)  LIVE IN NY is almost as good as the LIVE AT LINZ concert (above).  Parts of it are great.  And the music is less demanding than LIVE AT LINZ, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach) 10 separate Bach pieces, which include only two tracks from previous albums, and part of The Sea Named Solaris is mixed different.  Too bad this is hard to find and was not included in the big Box Set, but you CAN find it used on Amazon Japan, and G..... Chrome translates automatically, then with a little perseverance, you can figure out how to order from a seller who says they ship internationally.  Once I figured it out, it was easy, a great price, and in perfect condition.  This CD features some new sounds, moods, and musical styles for TOMITA Classical - a really wide variety of them.  Several of the tracks are most enjoyable. The popular Toccata and Fugue is a very good, virtuoso straight performance on very cool sounding Synth Organ (which I normally would not appreciate, but TOMITA gets away with it splendidly).  My subwoofer liked it too!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  SOUND QUALITY COMPARISONS OF MOST RELEASES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS  HOW I COMPARED THE SOUND QUALITY OF VARIOUS CD RELEASES Listening with Beyerdynamic DT990 Studio Headphones plugged into my Mac Pro, I played tracks from each pair of CDs using QuickTime Player 7 opened in two windows, and a keyboard command to switch back and forth (many times) for the comparisons.  I compared the SACDs and Surround CDs on my Surround System in the living room.  * * *  SACD NOTE The SACDs say DSD 4.0 on the cover, but they show DSD 5.1 when playing, and they DO use the Subwoofer, but NOT the Front Center Speaker, so they are actually 4.1, and that is perfect.  (I just double-checked that.  It is true.)  * * *  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 CLAIR DE LUNE  ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally, True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel Sound on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2000 High Performance Audiophile 24bit / 96KHz Super CD]  YES! This ONE TOMITA CD was mastered at 24bit / 96KHz for truly superior sound on ANY CD Player.  It is very bright and clean.  Smooth highs, deep bass, no distortion. Very nice.  CLAIR DE LUNE - ULTIMATE EDITION 2012 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  OK The standard CD tracks (playable on any player) sound very close to the same quality as the 24/96 Audiophile CD above.  Just a little tape hiss in some places.  [2006 CD from Box Set, 1986, 1991, 2004, or 2007 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss than Audiophile CD. Less bright. A little distortion.  [Dolby Surround CD]  NO The Surround Sound does not work on this CD.  * * *  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally!  For the first time for some of us, PICTURES in True Quadraphonic Sound. And it is spectacular!!  In fact, after waiting decades to hear this tune in 4-Channel Sound, the Ballet of The Chicks in Their Shells and The Great Gate at Kiev are incredibly stunning.  And of course, the DSD tracks are very clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION - ULTIMATE EDITION 2014 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  NO I don\\'t know what happened here, but listening with my headphones, the 2006 & 2007 JVC K2 CDs have a lot more depth and warmth, and sound a lot better than the regular tracks on the SACD.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  NO! Some sounds just fade to nothing when trying to move to the rear channel no matter what you play this CD on.  * * *  FIREBIRD 1976 [1991 Dolby Surround CD Dolby 5.1]  YES There is no extreme Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD]  YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  THE PLANETS 1976  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 [SACD - DSD 4.1 Surround]  YES! Finally!  True Quadraphonic for the first time ever for some of us!  Extraordinary Discrete 4-Channel separation on my surround system.  Ultra clean, pure and bright with deep bass.  The cleanest of the SACDs!  THE PLANETS - ULTIMATE EDITION 2011 [SACD Hybrid - Regular CD tracks]  YES This CD is the brightest and cleanest of all the regular CD tracks of THE PLANETS.  [2016 & 2012 blu-spec CD2, 2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  KOSMOS 1978  Note that this is the ONLY Tomita CD that is better on the Dolby Surround release.  [1991 Dolby Surround CD]  YES There is no extremely Discrete 4-Channel separation on this one, but the Surround Sound is actually pretty good, and all 5.1 Channels are used.  This One TOMITA CD sounded best after manually choosing Dolby Pro Logic II.  Also, it is brighter and cleaner with more full range than the CD in Box Set.  SPACE FANTASY 2015 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of KOSMOS) [SACD] OPTIONAL CD 1 has amazing Quadraphonic sound, but several tracks are missing. CD 2 is just Stereo, and only 22:05 long.  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD]  NO More tape hiss and a little sharp with too much midrange.  * * *  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES! Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BOLERO or DAPHNIS AND CHLOE 1980 (Ravel)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES! Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  OKHOTSK FANTASY 2016 (NOT an ULTIMATE EDITION of THE RAVEL ALBUM) [SACD] OPTIONAL No DAPHNIS AND CHLOE.  * * *  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (various)  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and a little less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1984 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE  This is the only TOMITA CD that got THREE completely different releases a long time ago...  THE BEST ONE IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE (RCA Records RCD1-5461)  YES [1985 U.S. CD Made In Japan (70:31) Black front and back.] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes.  Sound quality almost exactly the same as 1991 Japan Import.  Make sure you get exactly this one with this number: RCD1-5461.  UNUSUAL, EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE (BMG Japan BVCC 2512)  OK [1991 Japan CD. Gold front. Pink back.] Starts with Unanswered Question and announcements in Austrian. No Mars or Saturn. Very clean and bright, as if mastered from original master tapes. Sound quality almost exactly the same as the 1985 U.S. release.  EXCESSIVE TAPE HISS (BMG Japan BVCC 37514)  NO [2006 Japan CD. Gold front and back AND the CD in the Box Set (70:13)] Starts with Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Has Saturn and Mars. Dull music and Tape Hiss all the way through, as if mastered from a cassette. Note that with identical content, this 2006 Import and the CD in the Box Set are both 18 seconds shorter than the 1985 U.S. release, supporting the theory that this release was mastered from a cassette.  * * *  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH  [2006 CD in Box Set, 2004 & 2007 JVC K2 Japan CD] YES Brighter, warmer, louder, more powerful, with more Stereo Separation and less distortion than previous releases.  * * *  BACH FANTASY 1996 (J.S. Bach)  YES  There was only one Bach Fantasy release, and it is sparkling clean, bright, and deep.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  MORE ABOUT QUADRAPHONIC SOUND  SURROUND SOUND Sound effects and reverb (echo) that you occasionally hear in the rear channels.  QUADRAPHONIC Totally different from Surround Sound:  Whether listening to an orchestra, a band, synthesizers, or nature sounds, a Quadraphonic recording is Discrete 4 Channel Sound that puts the instruments or sounds separately, but at equal levels, into all 4 speakers around you all the time.  Note:  An old tune recorded in Quadraphonic does not become Surround Sound just because you are playing it on a Surround System.  The above definitions apply no matter what.  THE POPULARITY OF DIFFERENT SACDs I think I know why SACDs never became popular First, they can only be played on a blu-ray player that plays SACDs.  And even if a person already has a player that can play SACDs, and it is connected to a Surround System in the living room where Quadraphonic music would be perfect, most SACDs only have a little bit of reverb in the rear channels, so they don\\'t take advantage of that perfect set up.  Now that I have heard TOMITAs SACDs though, I want to try Quadraphonic SACDs and DVD Audios in other genres.  But time and time again, I find that true Quadraphonic discs are very expensive, while the price of most SACDs with nothing in the rear channels is WAY down. What does THAT tell you??  QUADRAPHONIC ON A BUDGET If you\\'re like me and never heard true Quadraphonic sound from a music tune before these TOMITA SACDs... Now you have to!  And you can do it on a budget! On Amazon do a search for blu-ray player sacd in electronics, and choose 4 Stars under Avg. Customer Review (on the left)...  Then do the same kind of search for receiver 5.1... Then search for the best you found for a good price and...  When buying used, make sure you can return the item, and test it right after receiving it.  If there are no HDMI connections on one component, thats OK.  Just make sure the blu-ray player and receiver have the same kind of output and input for Digital Sound, whether its Optical or RCA Coax...  Then add a good pair of speakers at ear level behind you, and a subwoofer.  Then connect the speakers with thick enough wires.  Then set your Receiver or Surround Decoder to auto detect the surround encoding, or set it to DSD, and be amazed!  When Quadraphonic sound began, 4 large speakers were required and were usually placed in the 4 corners of the room with the listener in the center of the room.  Surround (Rear) Speakers these days are typically smaller, so its best when SACDs use the Subwoofer, and Tomitas SACDs do.  * * *  ON PRODUCING JVC K2 CDs (2004, 2006, and 2007) The source material was first converted to digital via JVC\\'s patented K2 24-bit / 96kHz analog-to-digital converter, which uses advanced dither algorithms (without noise shaping). The musical information is next encoded on a magneto-optical disk for transport to JVC\\'s Yokohama manufacturing plant. The musical signal on the disk is down-converted to 16-bit through a K2 \"super-coding\" process before going through a proprietary \"Extended Pit Cut\" DVD K2 laser technology to produce a glass master. This optimizes the linear velocity of the glass master, giving precise pit lengths to eliminate time jitters, controlled by an extremely precise Rubidium Clock. All CDs are finally stamped directly from this glass master.  These CDs are noticeably THICKER than the average music CD is now.  * * * * * * * * * * * * *  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing TOMITA\\'s amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  Im flattered that this was copied and pasted to so many websites, but I would like you to know that I Am the original author.  Check the dates.  I first posted this on Amazon in March 2002. Thank You so much.  And THANK YOU MR. TOMITA! There is no collection of music I enjoy more.  Not even close.  Jeff Nielson, Modesto, CA',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'If everyday you could jump on a plane and jet to any remote corner of the planet, if you searched hard enough and dug deep enough, you would be almost certain to find a QUALITY reggae artist wherever you landed.  And not only will that artist probably be of quality in terms of talent, but the reggae listening community in that area will hold him/her in just about as high esteem as and in that particular area (ESPECIALLY if you happen to go to a smaller area) they will be just as popular as the more worldwide well known reggae act. And, its to my experience that it doesn\\'t even matter particularly if the artist has bust to a worldwide community (or if they EVER end up doing so). I have to say, however, that this phenomenon is generally ONLY true outside of the (spoiled) Caribbean, where as we seemingly don\\'t hold up and comers in as high of regard as they do internationally, thus, you can pick almost ANY island and you\\'ll notice that unless you PACK the show with local STARS, then you probably cannot attract a big crowd, unless you top the bill with a big Jamaican artist. Definitely as my tastes grow further and further, as well as my attentions I\\'m finding this to be particularly true all over the world. Check the UK. I didn\\'t know it until recently that, although we tend to look at the UK reggae scene as Jamaica circa 1975 (meaning just a few big names and A TON of lesser known lights), said big names such as Lloyd Brown, Peter Spence and Peter Hunnigale (I know more than one UK reggae head who refer to Hunnigale as the greatest voice reggae music has EVER had period) are so highly regarded and LOVED amongst their ever faithful group of fans. And while definitely I know of these names and (at least some of) their work, I can\\'t honestly remember I\\'ve heard ANY UK reggae artist with  the possible exception of Maxi Priest on any Caribbean reggae station at all. Similar would be the case of other European based artists like Ziggi from out of the Netherlands, German group Seeed and ESPECIALLY (German) Gentleman and Alborosie from out get HUGE respect and spins in the land of their birth, regardless of the fact that most European places (except the UK due to a large Caribbean population) aren\\'t typically regarded as traditional havens for reggae music. You could definitely say the same for Africa as well where artists like Tiken Jah Fakoly and the late and great Lucky Dube have the ability to sale out STADIUMS singing reggae music and you could go onto Australia, Japan and the whole of Asia as well, which I\\'m now learning carries a similar status with their reggae artists as well. Really and truly reggae music is of course going global, but its also strengthening itself LOCALLY as well, regardless of wherever `local\\' happens to be.  Another VERY vast resource for solid reggae artists and support for those artists is, of course in the States. I myself lived in the country for quite awhile (nearly a decade) and despite the fact that the area where I lived (in the Midwest) was almost BARREN of reggae talent, the few artists I encountered were opening for the big artists on all of the big shows and not just wasting time, but keeping the crowd excited. And while you\\'re very unlikely to find many solid reggae artists in my old stomping ground (big up Mellowman), should you find yourself in America and looking for top notch reggae talent, two places you can head to would DEFINITELY be California and Georgia. Incidentally California and Georgia are the two states which, in effect, brings us the artist in question here, Messenjah Selah. Messenjah Selah has about as PERFECT of a background for building a reggae artist who happens to move about a bit as he was born in Jamaica, moved and spent quite a bit of time in the Virgin Islands and when leaving the Caribbean altogether, landed first in Atlanta, Georgia and then in California where his name has become one of THE MOST popular you\\'ll see brimming on the US reggae scene altogether. I routinely get mixtapes from the west coast and there\\'ll be a Messenjah Selah track somewhere on the piece, if he, himself, isn\\'t hosting the disc altogether (which I\\'ve noticed he tends to do quite often). Seriously, you really won\\'t find too many reggae artists based outside of the Caribbean who aren\\'t elders and who aren\\'t bonafide superstars in the game already (like Gentleman) whose fans carry as much `quiet respect\\' for them and their skills as Messenjah Selah. Thus, releasing his new album, Breaking Babylon Curse for both Zion High and Lustre Kings Productions is kind of a big deal. Breaking Babylon Curse (to my knowledge) becomes Selah\\'s second album to date after the SOLID release, Whosoever Will which featured Selah alongside some of the genre\\'s best and most popular talents, particularly Sizzla Kalonji (wicked wicked track name Joy) and Luciano. Unfortunately, Whosoever Will was released nearly seven years ago back in 2002 on (I think now defunct) NDISI label. It was an album which took awhile to grow on me; after an initial spin through during which I deemed it (and Messenjah Selah for that matter) to be SOLID but UNSPECTACULAR. However, there was a stretch of six months or so about a year after getting the album where it ranked as one of the most played in my own players as it grew on me IMMENSLEY at that time. Therefore, personally I was quite looking forward to Breaking Babylon Curse (and even more so after first seeing the tracklist). Over the past few years Selah has occupied his time being one of the most active US based reggae artists on the performing side and voicing with several big name artists including the aforementioned Luciano (on the track called I Will Survive which was a decent hit for the original Messenjah and appeared on his own album Serve Jah from 2003) and Batch. Now, striking out on his own with a VERY nice slew of guests in tow on Breaking Babylon Curse and Selah delivers yet another very nice piece after a bit too long away from the album scene.  In terms of style I would probably say that the artist Messenjah Selah most resembles is probably someone like Ras Attitude where its almost like he, at times, seems conflicted as to what he should do, sing or DJ, but he does both very well (actually he DJ\\'s better than Attitude by comparison, but when Attitude sings, he COMPLETELY changes the game, one of the most complete artists in the business is the Cruzan chanter) (and he looks, does Selah A LOT like (ST. ANNZ!) Jamaican chanter Perfect, especially on the album cover) and his biggest talent, like Attitude`s mentor would definitely be his LYRICAL abilities. Getting things started out on his Breaking Babylon Curse is one of the project\\'s finest efforts altogether, the very nice and familiar to me personally, She Ask Me (Seh). The track seemingly finds Selah in a discussion with a new lady in his life who has questions about Rastafari and Selah\\'s path in life and she isn\\'t quite certain of what her entering that life may change in her own. Selah WONDERFULLY explains to her that in reality it isn\\'t about all the small things but the big one in itself; walking in the presence and the love of His Imperial Majesty. BEAUTIFULLY done and I and I\\'m sure many around the world can definitely relate. Strong opener there. Up next is the album\\'s first official combination alongside another US based artist, Jah Dan from Noble Society (who I seem to run into a lot these days) on Humble. Humble sounds like something (in terms of pacing and pacing ONLY) that you might find buried on a Midnite album somewhere. I\\'m still kind of on the fence about what I think of Humble: I like the track, its absolutely lovely, but I think it may be even BETTER than that, it could seriously be one of the best tunes on BBC, but it just hasn\\'t grown on me to that extent yet. Nevertheless, big track. Completing the opening for Messenjah Selah\\'s sophomore album Breaking Babylon Curse is another solid piece in Take A Minute. This track is another strong piece with a strong message; as Selah urges the masses to, \"Take a minute to give Jah the praise for the things he\\'s done for you, for the things he\\'s brought you through!\". Indeed. Nice start here.  As I mentioned, while Selah doesn\\'t tap many guests on BBC, the ones he does are very impressive and they work out well. After Jah Dan, stepping in is SHOCKINGLY Trini reggae STAR Queen Omega on Keep Africa On Your Mind, a very big tine . I don\\'t recall hearing the Queen on any Lustre Kings or Zion High projects before here and she is definitely a welcome addition here. Honestly she does outshine Selah when she does jump in fully, but the track as a whole is a MIGHTY vibes living in on exactly what the title starts. Lutan Fyah\\'s joining the album certainly isn\\'t a surprise at all, but the circumstances are. False Religion reigns as the strongest track on BBC altogether to my ears (I\\'m partial to Lutan Fyah tunes admittedly), thanks, in part, to the fact that the track flows WONDERFULLY over the nearly legendary Hard Times riddim! When the unforgettable stringing began the track my ears literally jumped up and the two deliver a might message that the false `religions\\' are diluting righteousness as a whole in the earth. BIG BIG TUNE! Selah shows just how mighty his pen is when left to his own creations as there are some downright BRILLIANT vibes on BBC. One which really caught my attention was the simple sounding Dirty House. Selah uses the `house\\' as the metaphor for the body and the soul and delivers a wonderful message to not only clean up oneself physically and mentally, but the acts that you do as well. You also HAVE to check African Bless! This track is seriously one of the best tunes on the album and had it reached the Whoseover Will album it would have been the best track, period, on that album. The track simply warns us not to lose the recollection of what we (people of Afrikan descent) have been through and not to lose sight of it. As Selah wonderfully says, \"Children of the Melanin stop practice the slave master teaching, or you\\'re going to get a beating!\". it\\'s a DEEP DEEP track and just has a very polished feel to it as well. Unseen Corruption is a track which steps up the pace a bit, but, again, hits its mark in terms of message. Going way back towards the beginning, Selah also scores three tunes in succession with Children Bring Me Joy, Woman Of Purpose and Focus. The HEAVY Focus is the best of the three which urges the masses to strip away all the way to the nonsense to really become stronger (the first verse on the track is MASSIVE!). Woman Of Purpose follows in the same vein as a track, Woman Of The Most High from the Whosoever Will album. While it isn\\'t the strongest such a track (the lover\\'s track portion may be an avenue where Selah could improve his skills), its still very well done to my ears. And the jovial Children Bring Me Joy is follows in the vibes of a track like Lutan Fyah\\'s Save The Juvenile where it finds Selah trying to set the stage of the world for the leaders of tomorrow. The track Two Face has a VERY Virgin Islands reggae sound to it (could have been a Bambu Station or even a Tuff Lion track in terms of sound alone) and it proves to be one of BBC\\'s finest track\\'s overall definitely. As the album winds down, you STILL have some very strong material (loving these eighteen track albums!). Check Their Story which, much in the same light as African Bless, reminds children of Afrikan descent not to forget where WE come form and not accept someone else\\'s teachings or `story\\' as our own. Israel Betta Know is a track which, based on title alone, I was looking forward to hearing and, although it isn\\'t the strongest of tunes here, it made my ears jump because it flows over a version of the same riddim which backed one of my favourite Lutan Fyah tunes, Don\\'t Waste Your Time (alongside Yami Bolo!), on an old Lustre Kings vibes. While Selah doesn\\'t reach those levels just quite he does do a nice job with Israel Betta Know, definitely.  I was looking for something to maybe change up the vibes on BBC (like a dancehall track or such) and while such a track doesn\\'t directly come, Babylon Fi Get Burn Up is about as close as it gets. The track features a HEAVY and CRAWLING riddim backing a more than slightly agitated Messenjah Selah. And to its strength, its pretty much a stereotypical sounding track (I would guess that he literally wrote it in a few minutes or so, it almost sounds like a freestyle) but it is still VERY good! Babylon and all their wickedness DEFINITELY get burn up! Sufferation is the almost obligatory acoustic track at first, but it soon develops into a WONDERFUL track (flowing over what sounds like a relicked version of the Drum Song riddim (Sizzla\\'s Mek Dem Secure)). Selah adopts a delivery which sounds A LOT like Chuck Fenda and that\\'s no critique at all. Sufferation is a big track, the final big track of the album The track which actually closes Messenjah Selah\\'s Breaking Babylon Curse, You Deserve is actually the obligatory acoustic track and my least favourite  track on the album. It does carry a great message, but its kind of corny sounding to be honest. Nevertheless the lion\\'s share of the seventeen tracks which proceed it more than make up for its presence.  Overall, I have to say that in the (VERY) brief time that I\\'ve had Breaking Babylon Curse, it has grown on me considerably. About a week ago (when I got it), after my first listen through, I had labeled it things adjectives like `boring\\' and `average\\', but definitely not now. Oddly enough, the same could be said, on a far greater scale, for the two previous Zion High which I bought, Ras Attitude\\'s Holding Firm (which I almost despised for a couple of YEARS before I finally started to hear its REAL quality) and Yami Bolo\\'s Rebelution (which sat unopened in a shoebox for more than a year before I even spun through it once and is now and has been for more than two years amongst my most favourite current albums). And just like those two albums, I\\'m recommending Messenjah Selah\\'s Breaking Babylon Curse for the more MATURE reggae listener. Its sound would definitely appeal to you far more and its nearly GOLD. It is also released virtually simultaneously with the far more celebrated Know The Road by Norris Man from Lustre Kings, but it\\'s a better album than that one definitely. The next time you, reggae head,  find yourself on some remote trip somewhere, definitely take a quick listen to the local reggae scene. If you find anyone like Messenjah Selah, with any skill like Breaking Babylon Curse, you may just find ANOTHER gem, like this one.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'If everyday you could jump on a plane and jet to any remote corner of the planet, if you searched hard enough and dug deep enough, you would be almost certain to find a QUALITY reggae artist wherever you landed.  And not only will that artist probably be of quality in terms of talent, but the reggae listening community in that area will hold him/her in just about as high esteem as and in that particular area (ESPECIALLY if you happen to go to a smaller area) they will be just as popular as the more worldwide well known reggae act. And, its to my experience that it doesn\\'t even matter particularly if the artist has bust to a worldwide community (or if they EVER end up doing so). I have to say, however, that this phenomenon is generally ONLY true outside of the (spoiled) Caribbean, where as we seemingly don\\'t hold up and comers in as high of regard as they do internationally, thus, you can pick almost ANY island and you\\'ll notice that unless you PACK the show with local STARS, then you probably cannot attract a big crowd, unless you top the bill with a big Jamaican artist. Definitely as my tastes grow further and further, as well as my attentions I\\'m finding this to be particularly true all over the world. Check the UK. I didn\\'t know it until recently that, although we tend to look at the UK reggae scene as Jamaica circa 1975 (meaning just a few big names and A TON of lesser known lights), said big names such as Lloyd Brown, Peter Spence and Peter Hunnigale (I know more than one UK reggae head who refer to Hunnigale as the greatest voice reggae music has EVER had period) are so highly regarded and LOVED amongst their ever faithful group of fans. And while definitely I know of these names and (at least some of) their work, I can\\'t honestly remember I\\'ve heard ANY UK reggae artist with  the possible exception of Maxi Priest on any Caribbean reggae station at all. Similar would be the case of other European based artists like Ziggi from out of the Netherlands, German group Seeed and ESPECIALLY (German) Gentleman and Alborosie from out get HUGE respect and spins in the land of their birth, regardless of the fact that most European places (except the UK due to a large Caribbean population) aren\\'t typically regarded as traditional havens for reggae music. You could definitely say the same for Africa as well where artists like Tiken Jah Fakoly and the late and great Lucky Dube have the ability to sale out STADIUMS singing reggae music and you could go onto Australia, Japan and the whole of Asia as well, which I\\'m now learning carries a similar status with their reggae artists as well. Really and truly reggae music is of course going global, but its also strengthening itself LOCALLY as well, regardless of wherever `local\\' happens to be.  Another VERY vast resource for solid reggae artists and support for those artists is, of course in the States. I myself lived in the country for quite awhile (nearly a decade) and despite the fact that the area where I lived (in the Midwest) was almost BARREN of reggae talent, the few artists I encountered were opening for the big artists on all of the big shows and not just wasting time, but keeping the crowd excited. And while you\\'re very unlikely to find many solid reggae artists in my old stomping ground (big up Mellowman), should you find yourself in America and looking for top notch reggae talent, two places you can head to would DEFINITELY be California and Georgia. Incidentally California and Georgia are the two states which, in effect, brings us the artist in question here, Messenjah Selah. Messenjah Selah has about as PERFECT of a background for building a reggae artist who happens to move about a bit as he was born in Jamaica, moved and spent quite a bit of time in the Virgin Islands and when leaving the Caribbean altogether, landed first in Atlanta, Georgia and then in California where his name has become one of THE MOST popular you\\'ll see brimming on the US reggae scene altogether. I routinely get mixtapes from the west coast and there\\'ll be a Messenjah Selah tune somewhere on the piece, if he, himself, isn\\'t hosting the disc altogether (which I\\'ve noticed he tends to do quite often). Seriously, you really won\\'t find too many reggae artists based outside of the Caribbean who aren\\'t elders and who aren\\'t bonafide superstars in the game already (like Gentleman) whose fans carry as much `quiet respect\\' for them and their skills as Messenjah Selah. Thus, releasing his new album, Breaking Babylon Curse for both Zion High and Lustre Kings Productions is kind of a big deal. Breaking Babylon Curse (to my knowledge) becomes Selah\\'s second album to date after the SOLID release, Whosoever Will which featured Selah alongside some of the genre\\'s best and most popular talents, particularly Sizzla Kalonji (wicked wicked tune name Joy) and Luciano. Unfortunately, Whosoever Will was released nearly seven years ago back in 2002 on (I think now defunct) NDISI label. It was an album which took awhile to grow on me; after an initial spin through during which I deemed it (and Messenjah Selah for that matter) to be SOLID but UNSPECTACULAR. However, there was a stretch of six months or so about a year after getting the album where it ranked as one of the most played in my own players as it grew on me IMMENSLEY at that time. Therefore, personally I was quite looking forward to Breaking Babylon Curse (and even more so after first seeing the tracklist).

       " {'reviewText': 'Fortunately, due to the rather majestic and explosive nature of the vibes and the performances, unlike many musical genres, Soca tends to be one in which women, at least in theory, can compete equally, if not even on better levels, with their male counterparts. As opposed to the `machismo\\' and downright sexism which seems to permeate its closest sibling, dancehall and even within roots reggae where the ideology at least appears to be one which is entrenched far more in tradition than in sexism, in soca, very little, if anything similar to that exists at all. As I\\'m learning more and more, I would definitely relate that more to Soca\\'s other `cousin\\' Zouk, where, even more so than in Soca, the two sexes appear to be vibing on even terms (of course it doesn\\'t hurt that in Zouk, women inherently sound SO MUCH better than men, ALL THE TIME) with some of the biggest names of that genre being of the fairer sex, just as in Soca. In Soca, specifically, women just appear to carry a bigger vibes at times than the men, who often times, even at the highest level, seem to get even MORE caught up in the aggressive side (like dancehall) and seem to forget that the point is to have FUN! My own very personal favourite Soca artist altogether in the world is the diminutive DYNAMO whom is Trini Destra Garcia who nearly single-handedly fostered my initial love and interest of Soca music and has definitely remained her status in my eyes, dropping absolute GEMS of tunes each and every Carnival Season. Of course, there are dozens and dozens of top notch female Soca artists in Trinidad alone, alongside Destra, headed by names such as the incomparable `Saucy Wow\\', Denise Belfon, the BRILLIANT Nadia Batson (also quickly becoming a favourite of mine), female lyrics machine Ms. Alysha, future superstar (if not already) Patrice Roberts and, of course, the lady of the moment, Queen without a crown , Fay-Ann Lyons, with many stepping up. But you could literally go around the region and at every major or minor stop find artists like - former road march winner Nicole David from out of St. Lucia; of course future superstars Zola and reigning Ragga Soca Monarch Dani-O from St. Vincy; reigning road march queen the previously unknown (at least to me) Miney and the WONDERFUL Nnika Francis from Grenada; even Jadine from Montserrat and you really don\\'t need me to get into what\\'s going on with Alison Hinds and company in Barbados, the subject could exist there and there alone and still be very detailed with the amount of impressive Bajan female soca talent these days. Truly, the women of Soca are not taking over, they have already TAKEN over (and keep an eye on Shakki from out of St. Kitts as well).  And perhaps nowhere does there exists an easier example of this than what has been occurring each and every season in Antigua for the last couple of years where unarguably their two most identifiable faces in Soca have been females. First, of course, another of my favourites is Tizzy, lead singer of the band El-A-Kru whose BIG style and very appealing delivery (and LOOK) had made her probably the most well known international Soca artist from out of little Antigua. While Tizzy definitely continues to make her name spread outward, THE dominate female name actually on the island is and has been for quite awhile, that of young veteran Claudette `CP\\' Peters who has scored and continues to score MAJOR hits in Antigua previously with the very respected outfit, Da Bhann and nowadays you can catch her each and every year performing with the very well regarded Taxik band. Taxik is actually one of the younger well respected bands, to my knowledge they\\'ve only been together less than five years or so, but in that short time have definitely made their presence well known and never before the presence of CP, really for what Soca is, she could be called a Star and definitely she is. CP\\'s style is just a bit different from most of her fast -talking peers as well which also helps to set her apart. Like Tizzy (but even more so) Peters can REALLY SING, she has a very nice and POWERFUL voice which could easily see her being a top rated Caribbean gospel singer if she had chosen (to my knowledge, she started singing in the church). She also has the `hardware\\' to prove her successes as she has won multiple titles/championships in her native Antigua (including, I THINK, four times and reigning Power Monarch AND two time and reigning Groovy Monarch), making her one of the most decorated Soca artists, period, female or male. In Taxik, she joins a very nice set of musicians and is the most popular and highly regarded of (I THINK) three official current lead vocalists, joining the well decorated in his own right Sleepy and Jamaican transplant singer, Kenny Blessin. Taxik, now brings what is their third album to date, by my count (following Bizniz Unusual in 2005 and 2006`s De Udda Side (the better of the two previous), the very impressive Method To The Madness featuring the majority of the group\\'s hits from the 2008 season and just generally big vibes throughout. Much like their counterparts in El-A-Kru (although they didn\\'t go as far as EAK did in lining up a deal) and many of the genre\\'s top (and not so top) acts are FINALLY doing in making their music available worldwide, not only to Caribbean people and to be perfectly honest, a great deal of these projects are quite hard to find (easy to order) on an island here other than the particular artist(s) in question own homeland. I\\'ve been so inundated with WONDERFUL and SPARKLING Soca music in 2008 that I think I\\'m almost jaded as to what can REALLY manage to get my attentions these days. However, Claudette Peters is the type of downright moving artist that I think could get to the most hardened and SPOILED of soca heads, whether you like her or not. Her presence in Taxik\\'s lineup, much like Tizzy\\'s in El-A-Kru (where she now remains the only vocalist on their current roster), just seems to make the vibes so much better. Although, she does have a nice bit of help from her two partners in Method To The Madness, making it a highly enjoyable album ultimately.  Method To The Madness is released by Taxik themselves (as were their previous releases I believe) and, much like St. Vincy artist Bomani last year, with his album Wet, they\\'ve gone international as I mentioned. The album wonderfully features a healthy mix of the vocalists taking a nice number of tracks on  their own, with, of course, Claudette Peters leading the show. She LITERALLY leads the show also as she dusts off her gospel chops and delivers MttM\\'s very nice opener, As Long As I Have, a straight gospel anthem. Much like Destra and Nadia Batson she also includes the gospel tune just to kick things in gear at the beginning. My ears don\\'t really adapt to gospel too well, but to her voice, they do. It is ASBOLUTELY spectacular and the entire Soca loving world owes a big \"I\\'m sorry\" to the gospel heads for `stealing\\' what could have been such a powerful voice for them (and may still prove to be at some point). Her voice is wonderful! After essentially saying grace, the bacchanal begins with CP herself again chiming in with one her big hits from this past season, the VIBRANT Mardi Gras which was probably her most spun tune (at least in St. Maarten) and took third place in Antigua\\'s roadmarch. Mardi Gras is simply AMAZING, love the big hype and the vibes all the way through. Excellent way to open things and easily one of the album\\'s finest. Completing the opening of MttM is our first dash of  Sleepy as he brings forth his somewhat comical and frustratingly addictive Country Boy. It\\'s a Soca-Square dance and you can probably imagine EXACTLY how the tune sounds (just like I did beforehand). After the album is over you certainly won\\'t rate Country Boy as one of it\\'s best, but you\\'ll probably STILL be singing it. All in all, a pretty nice opening.  I full on KNEW what would be the class of this album as I had been enjoying both of the tunes for the better part of the second half of 2008. Both of the songs, Jumping Away and Bring It On, sang by CP, were HUGE hits for her and the latter actually won her Power Soca Monarch this year (although Jumping Away s technically the lead single for this album). Which is better? I\\'m almost obligated to say Jumping Away, because it is so wonderfully complexly produced, almost sounding like two tunes in one. BUT, Bring It On grabs you and simply refuses to let you go AT ALL! Thus, Method To The Madness reaches its peak at Bring It On, but it gives you notice well into Jumping Away. I\\'ll also mention from CP briefly to check the very nice Carnival Day, which won her Groovy Monarch this year (there have been four Soca monarch titles in the past two years in Antigua and CP has won them ALL). Its almost difficult to tell the difference, save for the riddim, given her vocal strength, but Carnival Day has a very lovely old school calypso type of vibes to it, which really struck a chord in many people, your\\'s truly definitely included. Did I mention that there were other singers for Taxik besides CP though? Young Kenne Blessin makes his maiden voyage on MttM with what is, to my ears, his best effort, We\\'ll Be. The tune is BEAUTIFUL, having elements of both power and groovy Soca which is a type I love! And I\\'m expecting big things from the Kingston native (Jamaica can sing Soca!) in the future. Also check Blessin\\'s very nice and complex (listen to EVERYTHING happening in that riddim) Wrapped In My Arms, definitely one for the ladies and the couples as well with a pop type of feel to it, not my type of thing really, but again, I can imagine A LOT of people really liking the vibes on the tune. What IS my type of thing is Sleepy\\'s finest effort on MttM the super hype Everybody Crazy. Sounding like something from out of Jabae\\'s catalogue, Everybody Crazy sheds a bit of light onto an artist who, himself, is actually a MULTIPLE times Antigua Soca Monarch and having won all of his crowns (I THINK) after the turn of the century, so definitely not far removed from his prime and more efforts like Everybody Crazy, which is INSANE, and maybe his bandmate may have some competition right under her nose. Also check Sleepy\\'s very strong and old school tinged Rock De Boat which has another big sounding vibes, but from yesteryear, in this case. And I\\'d be just flat out WRONG if I didn\\'t mention CP\\'s BIG Still In Love. The tune definitely isn\\'t amongst my favourites here (although I do LOVE that swinging vibes on the riddim), but more than any of the others here, I think it could be a big crossover type of thing for her if it were ever given the proper push (and it won\\'t). As Method To The Madness winds down, some of the REAL madness really rolls out. The tune Dis Is Jouvert Morn, while it isn\\'t the strongest tune (although it definitely isn\\'t bad) features Sleepy, CP and Kenne all together on the same (VERY standard) anthem. To my ears, it comes off as a bit of a freestyle with the artists just singing pretty much whatever comes to mind. I would say that Kenne Blessin probably does the best of the three, but no one is really keeping anthem as its just a fun time on the tune. Blessin and Sleepy do a combination on the very familiar sounding Wickedest Wine, which is, again, not the best tune here, but I really just appreciate the switching up the vibes and adding bits and pieces there, especially in an album form and REALLY Wickedest Wine is the type of tune that takes a minute to grow on you, so I may STILL grow to more like it really. And ending Method To The Madness is the same one who opened it as  CP runs back in with two tunes. The first, Best Friend, a tune with more of a tangible message than the rest, one which tells you to be careful around those who claim to be your \\'best friend\\'. The tune really serves as a wonderful platform for CP\\'s voice (again) which does so many different things in the song and almost gets to a point where it becomes downright overbearing without becoming BORING at any point. Very interesting, to say the least. Ending things is another slow piece, this one even better than the opener as CP relicks the Jumping Away tune (remember I said it was like two tunes in one, it was, LITERALLY) in a very slow ballad style remixed version. You could argue (I\\'m not though) that the remix is every bit as strong as the original and I wouldn\\'t put up a great fight against the notion. What it does go to show is, just as her titles would suggest, Claudette Peters is just a really ODDLY equipped artist, having dimensions in her style and VOICE which allow her to do so many different things. Her peers in that are very limited and, from the top of my head I would say that only Trinis Shurwayne Winchester and Patrice Roberts and, of course, Alison Hinds have that type of range in their skills allowing them to do just about ANYTHING at the highest level of soca (with Fay-Ann and Destra being in there as well perhaps). Truly something special in CP and a truly special way to end Method To The Madness indeed.  Overall, big respect has to go to Antigua for having a breakout on the international side. Besides having some of the biggest tunes of the year altogether, fans all over the world are able to buy albums from the likes of young upstart and potential superstar Fucha Kid (Start It), of course El-A-Kru (Rocket Launcher), the Red Hot Flames (Scyahttah, the title anthem of which took Antigua roadmarch this year) and now Claudette Peters and Taxik\\'s very nice Method To The Madness as well. As the music really gets more and more international exposure, I REALLY think it\\'s the female artists that are going to be more and more in demand (because they aren\\'t as hard on the eyes either as the guys, to be honest) and definitely Claudette will be amongst the MOST in demand. She has taken what she has in her voice and all around personality and created what is certainly one of the most interesting sounds and ACCOMPLISHED rsums in Soca altogether these days. And here, together with Taxik (with whom I hope she stays) they have created yet another album winner from 2008 Soca, one of the strongest years musically in recent memory and one which will look almost PERFECT in the catalogue of any Soca fan. Very well done.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Fortunately, due to the rather majestic and explosive nature of the vibes and the performances, unlike many musical genres, Soca tends to be one in which women, at least in theory, can compete equally, if not even on better levels, with their male counterparts. As opposed to the `machismo\\' and downright sexism which seems to permeate its closest sibling, dancehall and even within roots reggae where the ideology at least appears to be one which is entrenched far more in tradition than in sexism, in soca, very little, if anything similar to that exists at all. As I\\'m learning more and more, I would definitely relate that more to Soca\\'s other `cousin\\' Zouk, where, even more so than in Soca, the two sexes appear to be vibing on even terms (of course it doesn\\'t hurt that in Zouk, women inherently sound SO MUCH better than men, ALL THE TIME) with some of the biggest names of that genre being of the fairer sex, just as in Soca. In Soca, specifically, women just appear to carry a bigger vibes at times than the men, who often times, even at the highest level, seem to get even MORE caught up in the aggressive side (like dancehall) and seem to forget that the point is to have FUN! My own very personal favourite Soca artist altogether in the world is the diminutive DYNAMO whom is Trini Destra Garcia who nearly single-handedly fostered my initial love and interest of Soca music and has definitely remained her status in my eyes, dropping absolute GEMS of tunes each and every Carnival Season. Of course, there are dozens and dozens of top notch female Soca artists in Trinidad alone, alongside Destra, headed by names such as the incomparable `Saucy Wow\\', Denise Belfon, the BRILLIANT Nadia Batson (also quickly becoming a favourite of mine), female lyrics machine Ms. Alysha, future superstar (if not already) Patrice Roberts and, of course, the lady of the moment, Queen without a crown , Fay-Ann Lyons, with many stepping up. But you could literally go around the region and at every major or minor stop find artists like - former road march winner Nicole David from out of St. Lucia; of course future superstars Zola and reigning Ragga Soca Monarch Dani-O from St. Vincy; reigning road march queen the previously unknown (at least to me) Miney and the WONDERFUL Nnika Francis from Grenada; even Jadine from Montserrat and you really don\\'t need me to get into what\\'s going on with Alison Hinds and company in Barbados, the subject could exist there and there alone and still be very detailed with the amount of impressive Bajan female soca talent these days. Truly, the women of Soca are not taking over, they have already TAKEN over (and keep an eye on Shakki from out of St. Kitts as well).  And perhaps nowhere does there exists an easier example of this than what has been occurring each and every season in Antigua for the last couple of years where unarguably their two most identifiable faces in Soca have been females. First, of course, another of my favourites is Tizzy, lead singer of the band El-A-Kru whose BIG style and very appealing delivery (and LOOK) had made her probably the most well known international Soca artist from out of little Antigua. While Tizzy definitely continues to make her name spread outward, THE dominate female name actually on the island is and has been for quite awhile, that of young veteran Claudette `CP\\' Peters who has scored and continues to score MAJOR hits in Antigua previously with the very respected outfit, Da Bhann and nowadays you can catch her each and every year performing with the very well regarded Taxik band. Taxik is actually one of the younger well respected bands, to my knowledge they\\'ve only been together less than five years or so, but in that short time have definitely made their presence well known and never before the presence of CP, really for what Soca is, she could be called a Star and definitely she is. CP\\'s style is just a bit different from most of her fast -talking peers as well which also helps to set her apart. Like Tizzy (but even more so) Peters can REALLY SING, she has a very nice and POWERFUL voice which could easily see her being a top rated Caribbean gospel singer if she had chosen (to my knowledge, she started singing in the church). She also has the `hardware\\' to prove her successes as she has won multiple titles/championships in her native Antigua (including, I THINK, four times and reigning Power Monarch AND two time and reigning Groovy Monarch), making her one of the most decorated Soca artists, period, female or male. In Taxik, she joins a very nice set of musicians and is the most popular and highly regarded of (I THINK) three official current lead vocalists, joining the well decorated in his own right Sleepy and Jamaican transplant singer, Kenny Blessin. Taxik, now brings what is their third album to date, by my count (following Bizniz Unusual in 2005 and 2006`s De Udda Side (the better of the two previous), the very impressive Method To The Madness featuring the majority of the group\\'s hits from the 2008 season and just generally big vibes throughout. Much like their counterparts in El-A-Kru (although they didn\\'t go as far as EAK did in lining up a deal) and many of the genre\\'s top (and not so top) acts are FINALLY doing in making their music available worldwide, not only to Caribbean people and to be perfectly honest, a great deal of these projects are quite hard to find (easy to order) on an island here other than the particular artist(s) in question own homeland. I\\'ve been so inundated with WONDERFUL and SPARKLING Soca music in 2008 that I think I\\'m almost jaded as to what can REALLY manage to get my attentions these days. However, Claudette Peters is the type of downright moving artist that I think could get to the most hardened and SPOILED of soca heads, whether you like her or not. Her presence in Taxik\\'s lineup, much like Tizzy\\'s in El-A-Kru (where she now remains the only vocalist on their current roster), just seems to make the vibes so much better. Although, she does have a nice bit of help from her two partners in Method To The Madness, making it a highly enjoyable album ultimately.  Method To The Madness is released by Taxik themselves (as were their previous releases I believe) and, much like St. Vincy artist Bomani last year, with his album Wet, they\\'ve gone international as I mentioned. The album wonderfully features a healthy mix of the vocalists taking a nice number of tracks on  their own, with, of course, Claudette Peters leading the show. She LITERALLY leads the show also as she dusts off her gospel chops and delivers MttM\\'s very nice opener, As Long As I Have, a straight gospel track. Much like Destra and Nadia Batson she also includes the gospel tune just to kick things in gear at the beginning. My ears don\\'t really adapt to gospel too well, but to her voice, they do. It is ASBOLUTELY spectacular and the entire Soca loving world owes a big \"I\\'m sorry\" to the gospel heads for `stealing\\' what could have been such a powerful voice for them (and may still prove to be at some point). Her voice is wonderful! After essentially saying grace, the bacchanal begins with CP herself again chiming in with one her big hits from this past season, the VIBRANT Mardi Gras which was probably her most spun tune (at least in St. Maarten) and took third place in Antigua\\'s roadmarch. Mardi Gras is simply AMAZING, love the big hype and the vibes all the way through. Excellent way to open things and easily one of the album\\'s finest. Completing the opening of MttM is our first dash of  Sleepy as he brings forth his somewhat comical and frustratingly addictive Country Boy. It\\'s a Soca-Square dance and you can probably imagine EXACTLY how the tune sounds (just like I did beforehand). After the album is over you certainly won\\'t rate Country Boy as one of it\\'s best, but you\\'ll probably STILL be singing it. All in all, a pretty nice opening.  I full on KNEW what would be the class of this album as I had been enjoying both of the tunes for the better part of the second half of 2008. Both of the songs, Jumping Away and Bring It On, sang by CP, were HUGE hits for her and the latter actually won her Power Soca Monarch this year (although Jumping Away s technically the lead single for this album). Which is better? I\\'m almost obligated to say Jumping Away, because it is so wonderfully complexly produced, almost sounding like two tunes in one. BUT, Bring It On grabs you and simply refuses to let you go AT ALL! Thus, Method To The Madness reaches its peak at Bring It On, but it gives you notice well into Jumping Away. I\\'ll also mention from CP briefly to check the very nice Carnival Day, which won her Groovy Monarch this year (there have been four Soca monarch titles in the past two years in Antigua and CP has won them ALL). Its almost difficult to tell the difference, save for the riddim, given her vocal strength, but Carnival Day has a very lovely old school calypso type of vibes to it, which really struck a chord in many people, your\\'s truly definitely included. Did I mention that there were other singers for Taxik besides CP though? Young Kenne Blessin makes his maiden voyage on MttM with what is, to my ears, his best effort, We\\'ll Be. The tune is BEAUTIFUL, having elements of both power and groovy Soca which is a type I love! And I\\'m expecting big things from the Kingston native (Jamaica can sing Soca!) in the future. Also check Blessin\\'s very nice and complex (listen to EVERYTHING happening in that riddim) Wrapped In My Arms, definitely one for the ladies and the couples as well with a pop type of feel to it, not my type of thing really, but again, I can imagine A LOT of people really liking the vibes on the tune. What IS my type of thing is Sleepy\\'s finest effort on MttM the super hype Everybody Crazy. Sounding like something from out of Jabae\\'s catalogue, Everybody Crazy sheds a bit of light onto an artist who, himself, is actually a MULTIPLE times Antigua Soca Monarch and having won all of his crowns (I THINK) after the turn of the century, so definitely not far removed from his prime and more efforts like Everybody Crazy, which is INSANE, and maybe his bandmate may have some competition right under her nose. Also check Sleepy\\'s very strong and old school tinged Rock De Boat which has another big sounding vibes, but from yesteryear, in this case. And I\\'d be just flat out WRONG if I didn\\'t mention CP\\'s BIG Still In Love. The tune definitely isn\\'t amongst my favourites here (although I do LOVE that swinging vibes on the riddim), but more than any of the others here, I think it could be a big crossover type of thing for her if it were ever given the proper push (and it won\\'t). As Method To The Madness winds down, some of the REAL madness really rolls out. The tune Dis Is Jouvert Morn, while it isn\\'t the strongest tune (although it definitely isn\\'t bad) features Sleepy, CP and Kenne all together on the same (VERY standard) track. To my ears, it comes off as a bit of a freestyle with the artists just singing pretty much whatever comes to mind. I would say that Kenne Blessin probably does the best of the three, but no one is really keeping track as its just a fun time on the tune. Blessin and Sleepy do a combination on the very familiar sounding Wickedest Wine, which is, again, not the best tune here, but I really just appreciate the switching up the vibes and adding bits and pieces there, especially in an album form and REALLY Wickedest Wine is the type of tune that takes a minute to grow on you, so I may STILL grow to more like it really.

       " {'reviewText': \"I often find myself speaking about just how Important the presentation of Reggae music can be on people who have yet to take a deep interest in our music or an interest at all. Often times, for whatever reason (usually monetary) Reggae doesn't receive the type of glitz and glamour surrounding releases and even down to the releases themselves which aren't always very well done in terms of general appeal. That being said, however, I think, in terms of the ULTIMATE form of presentation of anything (having someone who does/did something showing you THEMSELVES what they do/did), that Reggae music ranks right up there with the best of them as we are truly gifted with some OUTSTANDING performers. In fact, I think Reggae is one of the very few musical genres which can (and does) tangibly PUNISH artists who may not be very good with their performances. The prime example of such a thing would DEFINITELY be Dancehall superstar Sean Paul who, despite the fact that even the most critical observer of his would have to admit makes (at his best) some downright ADDICTIVE Dancehall tunes, was, for years, held back in terms of status in Jamaican Dancehall largely due to his week stage show. You could make the argument that it STILL continues to be a sticking point with his reputation locally with some fans also, his inability to recreate the same vibes in person that he does in the studio (although he has WELL improved in that area to my opinion). Similarly, but on the COMPLETELY opposite side of the spectrum is the legendary Ninja Man. If you've ever really listened to Ninja Man's music, you would have almost certainly noticed that he has about three or four melodies altogether. That's it. You'll notice that songs like Murder Dem, My Weapon and Border Clash all utilized roughly the same melody and, when listened to together through the course of an album, are quite boring. HOWEVER, should you have the good fortune of EVER seeing the Ninja live and in person (even if he's not at his best!) it's potentially an experience you'll almost certainly never forget. The man is that good. And with a very colourful and clear dependence on the live show as Reggae has, I often find it odd that we don't have more in the way of those performances transferred over to the disc (or the digital these days) for releasing to the masses. The fit would seem to be SO obvious and with a history which is so glaringly full of such material, the very fact that we it so rarely these days is confusing to say the least and we definitely give thanks to people like 2b1 who CONTINUOUSLY make `resource deposits' in the field of live Reggae albums.  That being said, perhaps it's wise, in one way or another, to look at the Virgin Islands which has largely become a `holding place' for many trends which seem to have left Jamaican Reggae over the course of time. It has gotten to the point where it has almost become a clich that Virgin Islands Reggae is Jamaican Reggae, circa 1975 as the way things are done (ESPECIALLY the actual musical output) are reminiscent of that era. Two things in particular apply from that in this case: Along with the aforementioned live presentation of the music is the concept of a fully functioning, self serving and EFFICIENT Reggae band which, aside from those groups such as Firehouse or Prophecy or Shiloh (which perform almost strictly in tour and with certain artists, Sizzla, Capleton and Buju Banton in these cases, respectively) (although Firehouse does work as a unit in terms of production although the quintessential lead singer role would typically vary in that case), has been all but lost in Jamaica over the past few years with very few literal exceptions (like Morgan Heritage). Not the case is that in the VI as the biggest and most well known Virgin Islands Reggae act is and has been for a very long time, Midnite. And although whatever 'Midnite' is these days remains up in the air, you'll often them, even still, referred to as the best Reggae `band' on the earth. And Midnite aren't the only ones, of course, the VI also boasts of big talents such as Bambu Station, The Reggae Bubblers, DAPP Band and others still such as The Zioneers and the Red I Band who act in much the same fashion as the previously mentioned Jamaican bands as they can back a variety of different artists (Bambu Station also does this but have their own lead singer in Jalani Horton. Well, if you hadn't already, feel free to now WONDERFULLY add to those ranks a band who has probably been around longer than all of them, Inner Visions from out of teeny tiny St. John. To speak to Inner Visions' presence in the music, I can rightly tell you that I have no idea, in terms of a timeframe, when I first heard of them, they've just ALWAYS kind of been there. Just last year, the group, which is largely made up of members of the same family, the Pickerings, released their fifth album overall and their very first Live piece, the fittingly titled Finally Captured Live (and I like the word Finally, meaning that obviously there had been quite a bit of requests of  the group to embark on such a project). The album was recorded as part of a tour the band made of Europe from 2007. Now, I could speak to the great performers we have in Reggae and I could speak to the downright STRANGE performers we have (like Elephant Man or Capleton, both of whom seem to ALWAYS strike the stage with passion generally reserved for a Soca Monarch stage) but what you hear with Inner Visions' performance on Finally Captured Live is something SO NICE, and yet SO WEIRD that I don't know if I've ever heard it to this degree in Reggae. While you definitely hear some type audience response and you hear what you might expect to hear in terms of vocal inflections of someone who is singing while moving, for the most part the Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live `captures' them making the music almost EXACTLY as they might in the studio. Absent are the usual `overhypeness' and such activity as Inner Visions just deliver the music as their fans will know it and their potential future fans should know it.  It's very interesting that of the groups I mentioned, just last year, Midnite also released their live album debut in the form of Live 94117 and just a few years back in 2006, The Reggae Bubblers also did the same with their effort, Live On Assignment. And were that not enough (and it was), Bambu Station also released a live edition of their Talkin Roots Tour (which featured a whole heap of VI artists, including Pressure Busspipe) on Project Groundation in 2006. It truly comes with the territory, I suppose. Now throwing their names into that market is Inner Visions whose Finally Captured Live gets started with the intro to the show and the first few tunes on the Love One Another Medley. Now this is interesting because it really isn't a matter of a `medley' as I would comprehend it usually (which would be a piece of a song followed by a piece of a song, followed by another piece) but is, instead, simply FULL song after FULL song, resulting in one track tapping out at just over a minute shy of a half an hour. The big name melody here is also the name of Inner Visions' very first album and what you'll hear here is considerably `better' than what you'll hear on that original album (and you can check it out as WONDERFULLY all of Inner Visions' catalogue is now digitally available) and still with the big and simple message of spreading the love to every corner of the planet. The next melody, Cool Reggae Rhythm, also gives the original a run for its money (it's certainly more `dynamic' sounding) as it keeps the levels seriously high and it was right about here that I started to question if I was listening to a LIVE album at all. One of my own personal favourites from the Inner Visions is up next, Pack Up Yo Bundle (it, like Cool Reggae Rhythm appears on the Spiritual Dancer album).This melody is BIG in any form you might hear it in and, again, even though it definitely has more of a `bounce' to it, you definitely don't want to neglect the message on the melody which is its REAL strength in my opinion. No More tears is a melody which came from the Street Corner Musicians album that I honestly didn't spend much time with but I recognized it almost immediately and it is a big song really but one which will ultimately take more than just a couple of spins through to be able to appreciate. The VERY solid Black Sheep (which is a lyrical highlight here and a melody which was probably very nice to see live) and the only melody on the album I don't like, School Daze (Love One Another album) wraps up what is otherwise a stellar start to Finally Captured Live.  Despite the fact that FCL has two nearly half an hour long `medleys' I could have told you what the finest melody here was even before it listening as it also contains a rendition of probably my favourite (at worst my second favourite) Inner Visions song altogether, the MAMMOTH Ethiopia which sounds so close to its original form (Street Corner Musicians album). Ethiopia is one of the most simple and less dramatic sounding pieces that you'll hear and it's absolutely brilliant on the literal and figurative levels. The melody is, essentially a repatriation anthem but it absolutely SPRAWLING and covers so many different subjects under that heading and does so on a vibes which you just cannot forget. BIG melody. Ethiopia is the signature of three basically `one-off' tunes sandwiched between the two Medleys. The other two are also very nice: Check Burn Down Babylon (which apparently was a new melody and may be featured on Inner Visions' forthcoming album Stay Alive in January 2010) and then there's Spiritual Dancer, the title track from the album of the same name, a melody sent in tribute to Bob Marley and definitely one of the signature tracks for which Inner Visions is known (it takes a minute to get going but it`s worth  the wait). The second medley, Rebel Medley is strong as well (although I might say that I prefer the first) and a definite highlight of Finally Captured Live. It begins with the melody Rebel (DUH) from the Frontline album (BIG song on that album by the name of Evelasting Love is the only Inner Visions melody I've heard that may be better than Ethiopia) which is a very nice and very comprehensively written melody to my ears. The song sort of follows in the line one might imagine, given the title but it also speaks of very `non-rebel' like activity such as friendship and love but apparently even Rebels need love (and some would say that especially rebels need love). The next melody on the medley, Can You Feel It is apparently quite the favourite with the crowd. I will say that I do enjoy this melody but it sounds absolutely EPIC on it's album, Frontline, so while the live rendition definitely held my attention, that original version still sticks out in my head. There's a melody later on the Rebel Medley that I didn't  too much recognize (apparently titled True Hearts) which is a pretty basic lovers melody but comes across so nicely in the form here. It was about this point (yes, it took this long, I'm embarrassed) where the quality of the instrumentation just becomes so obvious with the one drop on this melody which is downright ANGRY. And Blasphemers, another big melody from the Frontline album closes out the Rebel Medley. Unlike with Can You Feel It, Blasphemers sounds better on Finally Captured Live and ends with a stirring bit which then goes completely musical and is AWESOME at points. Well Done. FCL actually reaches its end with another single melody, Mr. DJ which is just a fun melody to send things out on and it isn't bad actually at all.  Overall the main thing initially is to not be fooled (as I was) by Finally Captured Live's misleadingly paltry six tracks as the so called medleys are absolutely FULL of rich material. I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't mix Everlasting Love in the set list this time around but I'm sure I'll catch it live myself one day. The Inner Visions are yet another DEVASTATINGLY talented name from out of the Virgin Islands and they've  taken a step like Finally Captured Live to absolutely just push everything in your face, leaving you with no excuses at this point: After a live album and four studio pieces, you can't really ask for too much more and, as I mentioned, FCL is SO well put together that it's almost like less of a `live album' and more of a greatest hits to a degree. So if you, being a fan of modern Roots Reggae (with a slight inclination to the old school) come to your senses and decide to `finally' check them out, Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live might not be too bad of a place to start.\",\n",

Two things in particular apply from that in this case: Along with the aforementioned live presentation of the music is the concept of a fully functioning, self serving and EFFICIENT Reggae band which, aside from those groups such as Firehouse or Prophecy or Shiloh (which perform almost strictly in tour and with certain artists, Sizzla, Capleton and Buju Banton in these cases, respectively) (although Firehouse does work as a unit in terms of production although the quintessential lead singer role would typically vary in that case), has been all but lost in Jamaica over the past few years with very few literal exceptions (like Morgan Heritage). Not the case is that in the VI as the biggest and most well known Virgin Islands Reggae act is and has been for a very long time, Midnite. And although whatever 'Midnite' is these days remains up in the air, you'll often them, even still, referred to as the best Reggae `band' on the earth. And Midnite aren't the only ones, of course, the VI also boasts of big talents such as Bambu Station, The Reggae Bubblers, DAPP Band and others still such as The Zioneers and the Red I Band who act in much the same fashion as the previously mentioned Jamaican bands as they can back a variety of different artists (Bambu Station also does this but have their own lead singer in Jalani Horton. Well, if you hadn't already, feel free to now WONDERFULLY add to those ranks a band who has probably been around longer than all of them, Inner Visions from out of teeny tiny St. John. To speak to Inner Visions' presence in the music, I can rightly tell you that I have no idea, in terms of a timeframe, when I first heard of them, they've just ALWAYS kind of been there. Just last year, the group, which is largely made up of members of the same family, the Pickerings, released their fifth album overall and their very first Live piece, the fittingly titled Finally Captured Live (and I like the word Finally, meaning that obviously there had been quite a bit of requests of  the group to embark on such a project). The album was recorded as part of a tour the band made of Europe from 2007. Now, I could speak to the great performers we have in Reggae and I could speak to the downright STRANGE performers we have (like Elephant Man or Capleton, both of whom seem to ALWAYS strike the stage with passion generally reserved for a Soca Monarch stage) but what you hear with Inner Visions' performance on Finally Captured Live is something SO NICE, and yet SO WEIRD that I don't know if I've ever heard it to this degree in Reggae. While you definitely hear some type audience response and you hear what you might expect to hear in terms of vocal inflections of someone who is singing while moving, for the most part the Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live `captures' them making the music almost EXACTLY as they might in the studio. Absent are the usual `overhypeness' and such activity as Inner Visions just deliver the music as their fans will know it and their potential future fans should know it.  It's very interesting that of the groups I mentioned, just last year, Midnite also released their live album debut in the form of Live 94117 and just a few years back in 2006, The Reggae Bubblers also did the same with their effort, Live On Assignment. And were that not enough (and it was), Bambu Station also released a live edition of their Talkin Roots Tour (which featured a whole heap of VI artists, including Pressure Busspipe) on Project Groundation in 2006. It truly comes with the territory, I suppose. Now throwing their names into that market is Inner Visions whose Finally Captured Live gets started with the intro to the show and the first few tunes on the Love One Another Medley. Now this is interesting because it really isn't a matter of a `medley' as I would comprehend it usually (which would be a piece of a song followed by a piece of a song, followed by another piece) but is, instead, simply FULL song after FULL song, resulting in one anthem tapping out at just over a minute shy of a half an hour. The big name tune here is also the name of Inner Visions' very first album and what you'll hear here is considerably `better' than what you'll hear on that original album (and you can check it out as WONDERFULLY all of Inner Visions' catalogue is now digitally available) and still with the big and simple message of spreading the love to every corner of the planet. The next tune, Cool Reggae Rhythm, also gives the original a run for its money (it's certainly more `dynamic' sounding) as it keeps the levels seriously high and it was right about here that I started to question if I was listening to a LIVE album at all. One of my own personal favourites from the Inner Visions is up next, Pack Up Yo Bundle (it, like Cool Reggae Rhythm appears on the Spiritual Dancer album).This tune is BIG in any form you might hear it in and, again, even though it definitely has more of a `bounce' to it, you definitely don't want to neglect the message on the tune which is its REAL strength in my opinion. No More tears is a tune which came from the Street Corner Musicians album that I honestly didn't spend much time with but I recognized it almost immediately and it is a big song really but one which will ultimately take more than just a couple of spins through to be able to appreciate. The VERY solid Black Sheep (which is a lyrical highlight here and a tune which was probably very nice to see live) and the only tune on the album I don't like, School Daze (Love One Another album) wraps up what is otherwise a stellar start to Finally Captured Live.  Despite the fact that FCL has two nearly half an hour long `medleys' I could have told you what the finest tune here was even before it listening as it also contains a rendition of probably my favourite (at worst my second favourite) Inner Visions song altogether, the MAMMOTH Ethiopia which sounds so close to its original form (Street Corner Musicians album). Ethiopia is one of the most simple and less dramatic sounding pieces that you'll hear and it's absolutely brilliant on the literal and figurative levels. The tune is, essentially a repatriation anthem but it absolutely SPRAWLING and covers so many different subjects under that heading and does so on a vibes which you just cannot forget. BIG tune. Ethiopia is the signature of three basically `one-off' tunes sandwiched between the two Medleys. The other two are also very nice: Check Burn Down Babylon (which apparently was a new tune and may be featured on Inner Visions' forthcoming album Stay Alive in January 2010) and then there's Spiritual Dancer, the title anthem from the album of the same name, a tune sent in tribute to Bob Marley and definitely one of the signature tracks for which Inner Visions is known (it takes a minute to get going but it`s worth  the wait). The second medley, Rebel Medley is strong as well (although I might say that I prefer the first) and a definite highlight of Finally Captured Live. It begins with the tune Rebel (DUH) from the Frontline album (BIG song on that album by the name of Evelasting Love is the only Inner Visions tune I've heard that may be better than Ethiopia) which is a very nice and very comprehensively written tune to my ears. The song sort of follows in the line one might imagine, given the title but it also speaks of very `non-rebel' like activity such as friendship and love but apparently even Rebels need love (and some would say that especially rebels need love). The next tune on the medley, Can You Feel It is apparently quite the favourite with the crowd. I will say that I do enjoy this tune but it sounds absolutely EPIC on it's album, Frontline, so while the live rendition definitely held my attention, that original version still sticks out in my head. There's a tune later on the Rebel Medley that I didn't  too much recognize (apparently titled True Hearts) which is a pretty basic lovers tune but comes across so nicely in the form here. It was about this point (yes, it took this long, I'm embarrassed) where the quality of the instrumentation just becomes so obvious with the one drop on this tune which is downright ANGRY. And Blasphemers, another big tune from the Frontline album closes out the Rebel Medley. Unlike with Can You Feel It, Blasphemers sounds better on Finally Captured Live and ends with a stirring bit which then goes completely musical and is AWESOME at points. Well Done. FCL actually reaches its end with another single tune, Mr. DJ which is just a fun tune to send things out on and it isn't bad actually at all.  Overall the main thing initially is to not be fooled (as I was) by Finally Captured Live's misleadingly paltry six tracks as the so called medleys are absolutely FULL of rich material. I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't mix Everlasting Love in the set list this time around but I'm sure I'll catch it live myself one day. The Inner Visions are yet another DEVASTATINGLY talented name from out of the Virgin Islands and they've  taken a step like Finally Captured Live to absolutely just push everything in your face, leaving you with no excuses at this point: After a live album and four studio pieces, you can't really ask for too much more and, as I mentioned, FCL is SO well put together that it's almost like less of a `live album' and more of a greatest hits to a degree. So if you, being a fan of modern Roots Reggae (with a slight inclination to the old school) come to your senses and decide to `finally' check them out, Inner Visions' Finally Captured Live might not be too bad of a place to start.\",\n",

       " {'reviewText': \"I often find myself speaking about just how Important the presentation of Reggae music can be on people who have yet to take a deep interest in our music or an interest at all. Often times, for whatever reason (usually monetary) Reggae doesn't receive the type of glitz and glamour surrounding releases and even down to the releases themselves which aren't always very well done in terms of general appeal. That being said, however, I think, in terms of the ULTIMATE form of presentation of anything (having someone who does/did something showing you THEMSELVES what they do/did), that Reggae music ranks right up there with the best of them as we are truly gifted with some OUTSTANDING performers. In fact, I think Reggae is one of the very few musical genres which can (and does) tangibly PUNISH artists who may not be very good with their performances. The prime example of such a thing would DEFINITELY be Dancehall superstar Sean Paul who, despite the fact that even the most critical observer of his would have to admit makes (at his best) some downright ADDICTIVE Dancehall tunes, was, for years, held back in terms of status in Jamaican Dancehall largely due to his week stage show. You could make the argument that it STILL continues to be a sticking point with his reputation locally with some fans also, his inability to recreate the same vibes in person that he does in the studio (although he has WELL improved in that area to my opinion). Similarly, but on the COMPLETELY opposite side of the spectrum is the legendary Ninja Man. If you've ever really listened to Ninja Man's music, you would have almost certainly noticed that he has about three or four melodies altogether. That's it. You'll notice that songs like Murder Dem, My Weapon and Border Clash all utilized roughly the same melody and, when listened to together through the course of an album, are quite boring. HOWEVER, should you have the good fortune of EVER seeing the Ninja live and in person (even if he's not at his best!) it's potentially an experience you'll almost certainly never forget. The man is that good. And with a very colourful and clear dependence on the live show as Reggae has, I often find it odd that we don't have more in the way of those performances transferred over to the disc (or the digital these days) for releasing to the masses. The fit would seem to be SO obvious and with a history which is so glaringly full of such material, the very fact that we it so rarely these days is confusing to say the least and we definitely give thanks to people like 2b1 who CONTINUOUSLY make `resource deposits' in the field of live Reggae albums.

However, I decided to give them one more shot with their sophmore album in the Spring of 2005. The album was \"Ascendancy\" and to be honest, I don\\'t think any album spent more time in my walkman than it that Summer. \"Pull Harder on the Strings of your Martyr\" was more of a religion than a hymn to me for a few months. The vocals were seen as metalcore, I didn\\'t see it like that though. I saw them more as progressive heavy metal. I mean, Matt Heavy was wearing a Darkthrone shirt in the promo picture. Doesn\\'t sound very trendy to me. Everything was a step up, even the vocals. I was lucky enough to see them live this Summer, they put on an amazing show. They played Detonation, this was the first time that I would hear any material from \"The Crusade\" Plus they played Master of Puppets, they played it perfectly. The new  vocals blew me away and the hymn writing  seemed quite sharp. So just like Ascendancy, everything was stepped up with this album,everything better than before. I see numerous influences in Matt\\'s new vocals, not just James H. This album is basically 80\\'s Metallica + Pantera + Megadeth. I hate how people whine about this album. This is 100 % pure heavy/thrash metal. I wouldn\\'t say this is the metal album of the year because Iron Maiden and Deicide both released classic albums this year,  however it is one of the best. Another thing I knew, the guitar is definetly more thrash influenced, while  not losing that Iron Maiden esque melody in them; this really pushes the boundries for what Trivium can do. The lyrics seem to me a bit more political than on previous releases, even though they hinted at it on Ascendancy. It doesn\\'t hurt the album lyrically, or come off as cliche and cheesy, which impressed me. Finally, the use of keyboards and  acoustic guitars are used occasionally. They are placed perfectly and set a wonderful atmosphere for the hymn.  1. Ignition (3:54) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  One of my favorite songs off of this album; you can really feel the Metallica influences on the verses, yet the chorus takes this hymn to a new level. With acoustic guitars and piano, along with melodic singing which blends well with the guitar. This hymn very much reflects society as it is today. The lyrics are well written. The hymn changes structures are quite different, yet they\\'re done smoothly and nothing seems out of place or forced. Around the 2:10 mark, Heafy has a short but wonderful solo before heading back into the thrash influenced verse/pre-chorus. This hymn ends with some haunting and creepy acoustic guitars that carrys over into the first few seconds of the next hymn. 5/5  2. Detonation (4:28) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  One of if not the best songs here. I love how Heafy flows his vocals through this hymn, it is carried out perfectly. It is impressive because if done the wrong way, it would have come out sounding sloppy and horrid. The Detonation chant gives reason to headbang and is a great chant live. Around 2:19, Matt Heafy starts some far away singing over a low melodic riff before heading into one of the best vocal parts of this album. In fact, the final two minutes of this hymn may just be the magnus opus for this album. This hymn also features the best solos on the album (2 by Matt and one by Corey) they have a really dramatic feel to it, almost epic. This hymn ends with one of the best melodic riffs I have heard in recent years. 10/5  3. Entrance of the Conflagration. (4:38) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  This hymn focuses more on Travis(drums) and paolo(bass) on the intro to this hymn. Which in my opinion, features Travis best work since \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" The chorus is typical (in a good way) for this album. Some good melodic singing. After the 2nd chorus  comes to a close, we have a  pretty thrashy interlude before the melodic chant of the intro comes back for the moment. Coreys solo screams Megadeth worship here, which is great. Matt on the other hand has a  more melodic almost flashy solo. It really shows off his talent. I believe the lyrical content, is in regards to the woman who supposedly killed her children in the name of God. In fact, it should be obvious as Heafy is quite blunt about it in his lyrics. 4/5  4. Anthem (We Are the Fire) (4:03) Music: Heafy, Gregoletto / lyrics: Heafy  This hymn really does seem like a good representation/ Anthem (no lame pun intended) for this album. Definetly a hymn I could see being mind blowing live. THe guitar is some good catchy thrash. I love the lyrics in the chorus, they really oculd pick up  and inspire anybody in need of it. Plus the group scream of \"We are the fire!) is great. Half way through, Corey and Matt go back and forth with dueling solos before those  crashing anthem drums kick in, with a chant. My heart took an extra beat after I heard this war chant outro. I could find no better way to end this hymn. However, it manages to pull off another amazing performance of the chorus before it goes out with a bang. I could see this as a classic thrash hymn in 10 years. 5/5  5. Unrepentant (4:51) Music: Beaulieu / Lyrics: Heafy  The intro riff, seems like it may have  fit with comfort on Metallica\\'s \"Master  of Puppets\" album. This hymn has some odd lyrical content of a man with 5 children (four daughters and one son) along  with his wife. Apparently, as the story tells us, one of his daughters commits adultery because of this, he feels the need to kill all his  daughters. The first verse vocal wise, are typical yet hte rest is nothing but. Heafy\\'s vocals are shockingly good here, I didn\\'t know he had a performance vocally like this in him. Everything about this hymn, is heavy yet has such a melancholic atmosphere to it. Which just goes to show you the range this band has in it. Coreys solo is pretty fast and respectable. I lvoe the riff  that comes in after his solo, before launching into mroe amazing vocals. 6/5  6. And Sadness Will Sear (3:34) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  This hymn, is much slower and has a creepy feel to it. Exspecially at the start. The music feels rather simple here, or atleast compared to the rest of the album. It isn\\'t a ballad type hymn, just a sad eerie one. Paolo really adds to it with his wonderful bass work. The bridge really is what makes this hymn  amazing. All of a sudden a much more melodic kicks in and Matt sings his heart out with some poetic lyrical content, then Matt comes in with another great solo, which is  basically the icing on the cake for me. Before heading into the eerie chorus with the help of another great riff brought to you by Corey. By this time, the hymn slowly dies out. 4.5/5  Becoming the Dragon (4:43) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  This is definetly a more Iron Maiden influenced hymn musically. Which at first seemed to me, as if it clashed with Heafy\\'s thrash metal vocals but over the the first minute or so, they blend together much better. The chorus only further proves this point in my eyes. Then at 1:25, the hymn crashes down a big wave of headbanging greatness. At this point, Matt adds some of his Ascendancy style vocals, which are perfectly placed. Then the music does a 360 back to a thrash style which includes Corey ripping up anohter great solo. Then it basically repeats itsself. Which is perfectly fine with me. The hymn  is then put together  by two solos one by Paolo and then Heafy finishes it off. 5/5  8. To the Rats (3:42) Music: Gregoletto / Lyrics Heafy  This shorter hymn, starts with a single riff before Travis brings the hymn full circle. The lyrics here sound cheesy. Lyrically, it seems to try to recapture the arrogant swagger that was the classic \"Walk\" by Pantera. However, Matt can\\'t capture it like Phil Anselmo was able to. This is probably my least favorite hymn here, even though it is still pretty decent. I just wish the hymn wasn\\'t so predictable. Which this does suffer from. Even the solos sound a little stale. It is still worth a few spins though. What makes it said,is Travis he really gives a great performance. 3.5/5  9. This World Can\\'t Tear us Apart (3:30 Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  Every great album, needs a great ballad. This is one of the best ballads i\\'ve heard in years. This hymn, features the most melody and some really heart felt vocals/lyrics. The chorus, as catchy and  corny as it is, holds a special place in my heart and sounds great to me. A really touching hymn, with anybody with a special somebody should appreciate. This hymn is also a nice breathe of fresh air as it is much more mellow than songs before/after on this album. The hymn takes a small break with a solo and guitar change before heaidng back into the epic chorus. Truly a well written ballad. 6/5  10. Tread the Floods (3:33) Music: Beaulieu / Lyrics: Heafy  Just when you thought it was safe.......the next hymn starts off with a signature Trivium riff and some slow drumming, before heading into a verse with a really nice back and forth riff between Matt and Corey. Heafy experiments a bit with his vocals, trying to sound a little less scratchy. I\\'m not really sure if it works for him or not, I would have to hear him use it more. The guitar work is what really makes this hymn works. It goes from slow to fast in the snap of a finger. Corey then breaks the door down on that idea with a lightning fast solo which leads into a melodic fill in from Heafy. Some of the best guitar work you will find on this album. 4.5/5  11. Contempt Breeds Contamination (4:28) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: Heafy  This hymn wastes no time to pick up speed. It is going 100 mph right out of the starting gate. Heafy has some great vocals as the guitar almost seems to bring out his vocals even more. This is seen most of all in the pre-chorus. This hymn, basically seems to be about those who left us behind when the died in vain. I could listen to the pre-chorus/chorus all day. It really brought out the potential this hymn had. This hymn also has something rare for Trivium. The solos here, aren\\'t lightning fast per say. It takes its time to build up. it really fits well and doesn\\'t force anything. 5/5  12. The Rising (3:44)  Music: Greggoletto / Lyrics: Heafy  Another amazing performance by Travis, who really was an unsung hero on the majority of this record. It has a few forgettable guitar riffs but the rest of the hymn saves it from being lost among the other songs. Another anthem like chorus that is slower but should get the heart thumping. The hymn will throw you for a loop. When you think it goes left, it goes right and vice versa. Should please fans of Megadeth\\'s slower work such as the \"Youthanasia\" album. I thought this hymn would choke out at 2 and a half minutes but coreys great guitar and travis\\' anthem like drums shock it back to life as Heafys moivating message closes out the hymn. 5/5  13. The Crusade  Music: Heafy  We now arrive at the epic 8 + minute outro/insturmental. It is quite amazing to say the least. It ends this album with a talented bang. You rarely see songs like this pulled off well these days. This hymn features 5 solos. One by paolo, two by Matt and two by Corey. They really put their heart into the guitar work here and it shows. the first 1 minute + is non stop thrash before a slower melodic riff kicks in and the rest of the hymn can take a breathe. However, the hymn slowly finds itsself getting into a groove again with this new found riff, until it goes to another musical change and maybe the best for this hymn around 2:20. The solo pulled off after it is pretty quick but beautifully done before pulling back into riffs past on this hymn. As soon as that groove comes back, Matt and co aresure to rip your throat out with sped up thrash metal. This goes on for the next 5 minutes, solos back and forth before at 8 minutes the music slowly starts to die away. Ending this amazing journey.  To end this, Trivium is a band that gets a bad rep from some people, for no real reason. They are an amazing and talented band in my eyes. As I said a while back, if they keep releasing albums  like this, they will join the lieks of classic thrash bands of past, present and  future. Enjoy.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I\\'m a fanatic for comedy albums. After playing some of my favorites to death (Norm Macdonald, Harland Williams, Jim Gaffigan, pretty much everything Louis CK and Dave Chappelle have ever done), I went off in search for more. I found some gold, some pewter, and some plain old garbage. Here are the fruits of my labors.  DEMETRI MARTIN --> Standup Comedian Much like his very obvious influences (Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg), Martin\\'s jokes come fast and loose and are based mostly on funny comparisons, puns, curious juxtapositions, and goofy over-analyzing/personification of common stuff. He rarely has any extended bits, preferring a rapid, conveyor-belt style of quipping. It serves him well. Most of his jokes work great, but when they don\\'t, his style means the misfire isn\\'t long remembered. Also, since he packs so many lpms (laughs per minute), his sets are almost always worth multiple replays, which is a huge plus for comedy albums. FIVE STARS  KYLE KINANE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Whiskey-Icarus/dp/B00A8Z5V38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Whiskey Icarus</a> Like a lot of comedians, Kyle struggles with self-image, self-acceptance, and just plain old living in general. Most comedians try to churn that material into comedy gold, but it very easily can come across as desperate and sad. Not so here. Kyle\\'s rugged delivery, well-spoken self-deprecation, and slippery insight into a misery that most people share makes the whole set seem like you\\'re having a slightly buzzed chat with a philosopher who can\\'t stand pretentiousness. He\\'s a dark horse of a charmer with a wacky and invasive wit. FIVE STARS  HANNIBAL BURESS -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Name-is-Hannibal/dp/B003YZ2W72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Name is Hannibal</a>&nbsp;/ Animal Furnace Hannibal has a very casual, friendly delivery that is polished without seeming over-rehearsed. He\\'s got a ton of charisma on the mike, and his jokes manage to mingle just the right amount of intelligence with an equal measure of absurdity. He reuses a few bits from one album to the next, but they\\'re both still A-list material from beginning to end, and it all has a high replay factor. I\\'m looking forward to more from him in the future. FIVE STARS  BRIAN REGAN -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/All-By-Myself/dp/B006RNEBF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">All By Myself</a> Still one of my favorite comedians, Regan is known for both his squeaky-clean material as well as his exaggerated, almost cartoonish delivery. He\\'s basically a giant kid, and the results are consistently funny. In an era where it\\'s really tough to wring laughs out of a crowd without going blue, Regan stands out as an immediately likable, inoffensive presence that manages to hit killer bits off with impressive regularity. FIVE STARS  TJ MILLER -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mash-Up-Audiofile/dp/B00A3AZTSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mash Up Audiofile</a> TJ Miller just doesn\\'t have enough stuff out there. He has a DVD, but I prefer to listen to my comedy, being on the go as I always am. I\\'ve caught a lot of Miller on various podcasts, and I\\'ve loved his general aura enough to seek this gem out. He\\'s got a lot of lunacy to his bits, but his goofy demeanor makes it super accessible. He runs the gamut as far as subject matter, and that makes the direction of his set unpredictable and more interesting. Plus, the CD contains some musical remixes of his jokes, a gimmick that I\\'ve never seen before. It doesn\\'t work 100%, but it\\'s still fun and infectious, like most of his comedy. FIVE STARS  PAUL F. TOMPKINS -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Laboring-Under-Delusions/dp/B009P3TOQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Laboring Under Delusions</a> I absolutely love Paul F. Tompkins. He\\'s smart but not smug, and he applies his well-spoken erudition to topics all across the board, whether grim, crass, classy, or just plain silly. This album follows Tompkins\\' career choices from school to his life as a stand-up comedian and sometimes actor, with all of it tied together by Tompkins\\' intense fear of being yelled at. Perfectly organized and arranged, the set is very personal without being maudlin or dramatic, and of course, it\\'s hilarious. Here\\'s hoping he doesn\\'t wait another three years to put out his next album. FIVE STARS  CHRIS HARDWICK -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mandroid/dp/B00AXVFVSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mandroid</a> Helmsman of the popular Nerdist podcast, Chris Hardwick has an innate pleasantness and a personal dismissiveness that\\'s endearing. His material has been very thoroughly refined and distilled so that it\\'s sharp and on point but also conversational. At least two of these bits I\\'ve heard before on a Comedy Death Ray compilation that came out six years ago, though, so it\\'s a bit sad he hasn\\'t come up with all-new stuff in the rather long interval. When he gets overly self-aware, the set stalls a bit (both tracks about being a nerd fall flat for me), but otherwise it\\'s light, enjoyable, and quickly paced stuff that goes down easily and with a lot of verve. FOUR STARS  NATE BARGATZE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Yelled-At-By-a-Clown/dp/B0096YBAK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Yelled At By a Clown</a> I\\'d never heard of Nate before this album. His slow-as-chowder southern drawl and passive, teddy-bearish personality both work for and occasionally detract from his set. While his material never really hits belly buster territory, it\\'s genuinely amusing stuff, but mostly when he\\'s actually trying to do typical set-up/punchline type bits. When he tells stories, he makes the amateurish mistake of having a dry, unremarkable chunk of exposition preceding the actual funny parts. This is exacerbated by his meandering vocal style. (I wish more comedians would take their cues from Louis CK, who has the ability to tell a long, involved story, and somehow still have nearly every line of it contain some kind of joke or humor.) Not bad for what I\\'m assuming is a relative newbie, but also not as good as it seems like he has it in him to be. FOUR STARS  DOUG BENSON -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gateway-Doug/dp/B00DIQUIRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gateway Doug</a> I\\'ll never give up on Doug Benson, but mainly because I think his podcast (Doug Loves Movies) is one of the most consistently enjoyable ones out there, and I\\'d say at this point he\\'s given me three to four hundred hours of free entertainment just from that alone. I feel I owe the guy. That having been said, this is one of the weakest sets Doug has ever released. It doesn\\'t have the honed strength of a batch of tried/tested/tightened material. Instead, it feels as gangly and loose as one of his podcasts, except without the guests there to riff with, Doug ends up sounding like he\\'s just rambling stream-of-consciousness style through some random ideas. A few of the bits are winners (\"No Smoking Rooms\" & \"Sober October\" are my favorites) but overall the whole thing is pretty weak. He might want to reconsider his \"release a new album every year\" philosophy and work on building up an hour\\'s worth of actual top notch material before laying down another album. THREE STARS  MIKE LAWRENCE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sadamantium/dp/B00CSSMIPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sadamantium</a> This album was a shot in the dark for me; I\\'d never heard of Mike before nor knew anything about his style. Essentially, he is trying to be another one of those comedians who bases most of his material on self-deprecation, like Kinane higher up on this list. I\\'ve noticed more and more comedians attempting this s***ck -- making themselves the butt of most of their jokes -- and while it can sometimes work (see Kinane), it more than often doesn\\'t. It\\'s a deceptively easy style to attempt, and unless you can add some unique pathos, creativity, insight, or character to your personal insults, it just comes across as lazy and uninspired. Unlike Kyle\\'s gritty, trailer-park-ish delivery, Mike has a nasally, salivary twang to both his voice and his jokes. Some of it works (\"Fallen Heroes\") and some of it doesn\\'t (\"British Stuff\"). It sounds overall like someone mingling old and new material at an open mike. Also, whereas Kinane, for instance, immolates himself with a sort of careless, lyrical abandon, Lawrence\\'s stabs at himself seem closed off and forced. In other words, Kinane\\'s personal digs are charming because they feel genuine and unique (and often weirdly poetic), whereas Lawrence\\'s personal digs actually distance him from the listener. He seems to be using them for the sole purpose of getting the audience to like him, making it sound disingenuous. Funny in parts, but the whole thing just felt like pandering to me. THREE STARS  MITCH FATEL -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Public-Display-of-Perversion/dp/B00B0NALDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Public Display of Perversion</a> Mitch has officially lost me. I used to love his work. Even if it was one note (he pretty much talks only about sex), he still managed to find a freshness in it, mostly because of his on-stage persona: he does his stand-up as if he has just sustained some kind of mild head trauma, with a hint of a peach inspediment to his voice that makes him sound stuck in a desperately horny, adolescent limbo. Obviously an affectation, the voice still worked perfect counterpoint with his pretty risque and self-deprecating humor. That has changed with this album. Although he still has that vocal affectation, the self-deprecation in his jokes is gone, and now he\\'s bragging about how his relative success on the comedy circuit has lead to all manner of sexual conquests: dating models and the like. The effect is a turn-off. Taking his persona from needy underdog to self-congratulatory top dog only emphasizes how stale, tired, and insincere his overall shtick really is. TWO STARS  MOSHE KASHER --> Everyone You Know is Going to Die, Then You Are This is more than a comedian doing stand-up. There are brief sketches at the beginning and end as well as a few epistolary segments here and there in the middle. If the title of the album isn\\'t a giveaway, Moshe tries to lean on the irony of mortality as both his opener and closer. It doesn\\'t work, mainly because he doesn\\'t actually write any jokes about it. He just reminds everyone they\\'re going to die, as if the juxtaposition of a comedian being morbid is, in itself, supposed to be funny. It\\'s not. Neither is anything else he talks about. The actual stand-up seems half-finished, with pretty much every melody on this album feeling like it is all set-up with no punchline. (\"Jewmany\" is the most obvious example of this.) The other bits are either overwritten (his letter to Modesto) or lazy (he reads spam emails and then makes obvious jokes about them, which is something everyone has been doing with their friends since email spam was invented). Making the whole thing worse, Moshe\\'s on-stage persona feels only a shade lighter than carnival barker. He\\'s got the contrived, overly-polished patter of a used car salesman. Even if your jokes are weak, if you\\'ve got a strong, engaging presence it makes up for a lot. Moshe\\'s slickness comes across as plastic and hollow -- like he lacks any kind of personality or presence at all -- and it totally deflates what little humor there is in any of the stuff he says.

       " {'reviewText': 'The Track List  This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:  Overture The Grid Father and Son The Son of Flynn Encom Part I Encom Part II Recognizer Armory Arena Round One Rinzler The Game Has Changed Outlands Father and Son Adagio For Tron Nocturne Outlands, Part II Reflections End Of Line Castor Derezzed Fall Sea of Simulation Rectifier Disc Wars C.L.U. Arrival Flynn Lives Sunrise Prelude Tron Legacy (End Titles) Solar Sailer Finale  The Pieces  Overture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.  The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don\\'t care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.  Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.  The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.  Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.  Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.  Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it\\'s one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.  Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.  The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.  Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.  Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn\\'s creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.  Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It\\'s slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.  Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.  End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" anthem on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.  Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don\\'t care for the electronic distortion on this anthem as it distracts from the main musical theme played.  Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it\\'s the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.  Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook\\'s Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good anthem if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.  Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.  C.L.U. is naturally the villains\\' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.  Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It\\'s the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.  Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.  Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It\\'s the last anthem in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.  Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It\\'s an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.  Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite anthem as it\\'s just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it\\'s a favorite anthem for many people (including my girlfriend).  Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.  The Score  Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It\\'s THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).  The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn\\'t know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk\\'s album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don\\'t believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn\\'t fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn\\'t have worried.  Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn\\'t disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...  This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.  Too Many Adagios?  It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven\\'t guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk\\'s past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.  Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception\\'s score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).  Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk\\'s Greatest Achievement  When I heard the anthem Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).  It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.  Special note on the LP edition of the score:  This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one anthem missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive anthem. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.  Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.  Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.',\n",

It\\'s the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.  Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It\\'s an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.  Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it\\'s just not progressive enough in its cut for my taste, but it\\'s a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).  Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.  The Score  Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It\\'s THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).  The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn\\'t know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk\\'s album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don\\'t believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn\\'t fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn\\'t have worried.  Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn\\'t disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...  This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.  Too Many Adagios?  It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven\\'t guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk\\'s past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.  Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception\\'s score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).  Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk\\'s Greatest Achievement  When I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).  It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.  Special note on the LP edition of the score:  This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one track missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive track. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.  Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.  Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Nights Are Forever is England Dan & John Ford Coley\\'s biggest shanty for a big reason... make that two reasons!  \"Lady\" is a country ballad with a good chorus and a decent laidback verse melody.  \"Many highways I\\'ve been on since I went chasing a song, and I left you standing alone in the soft morning sunlight.  Now it\\'s summer just like it was then, you were waving goodbye in the wind, and I heard you ask if I intend to ever settle down\".  The chorus is more upbeat.  \"Lady do you still seek the mysteries of life?  Or have you become some businessman\\'s wife?  And do you still long to be free, lady when you stare up at the stars out in the night, do you still think this old world would turn out right and do you ever think of me?\"  The second verse melody is really good lyrically as you can tell!  \"The moon lit and danced on your hair, we sat for some time on the stairs, and I\\'d give anything that we could share those moments again, but I\\'m surrounded by velvet and gold and strangers who offer their souls, but they all seem so hollow and cold, when I remember you\".  Wow, sounds like England Dan & John Ford Coley are fed up with fortune and fame!  \"The Prisoner\" starts off with an eerie flute solo that reminds me of glancing out at the wilderness many miles away.  This Spanish guitar line comes in.  Too bad it\\'s brief.  The verse melody reminds me very strongly of Seals & Croft\\'s more mystical-sounding acoustic stuff.  \"Take us to the prisoner, let us gaze into his eyes to see what kind of man it takes a nation to despise, take us to the prisoner let us look upon his face to see why 20,000 men would gladly take his place\".  The melody reminds me of Paul Simon during the line \"Won\\'t someone give a drink to him, remove the chains and let him live, let him live\".  More lyrics- \"Take us to the prisoner let us listen to his voice to see why worlds of wisdoms in a cell without a choice, take us to the prisoner torn and bent beneath the chains, we wonder if the world is really worthy of his name\".  The final line is really good too- \"Take us to the prisoner with his eyes so full of grace, the priests have lied and kings have died filled with their own disgrace\".  These are GREAT lyrics!  \"I\\'ll Stay\" is a happy ballad, but somewhat forgettable.  \"Happy times like pens and dimes, they slip away you turn around they\\'re goooooone one day, but I\\'ll stay\" is a VERY soothing line!  \"Empty words like winter birds, they leave the next they join the rest then flyyyyy away, but I\\'ll stay\".  The song picks up the pace with the next part- \"\\'I\\'ll be there in the morning when you wake up, I\\'ll be by your side, I\\'ll be there in the evening, with your soul in mine, I\\'ll be there in the morning from the moment you begin to rise, I\\'ll be there in the evening, keep you satisfied, satisfii-ii-ied!\".  The mellow part returns (\"Fairweather friends like temper winds, they roll along they sing their songs, they blooooow away, but I\\'ll stay\".  The \"But I\\'ll stay\" part thrown on at  the end sounds a little forced unless I\\'m completely crazy about that.  Maybe I am completely crazy!  The lyrics get eerie with the line \"One by one they\\'ll all be gone, but everyday and in everyway and for always I\\'ll stay\" before ending on a pleasant note with the lyrics \"Feeling worn on pages torn, and near the end the ink begins to faaaaade away, but I\\'ll stay I\\'ll stay\".  \"Westward Wind\" has an upbeat and meaningful verse melody that STRONGLY reminds me of Bob Welch (of Fleetwood Mac fame) and a chorus that reminds me of the Eagles early country period.  \"Seems I remember her best when the moon is high, and on the horizon she waits where the sea touches the sky, we\\'ll make up for time we\\'ve lost and days gone by, and we\\'ll walk the beaches, live the way the island teaches, oooooooh westward wind, filling my sails and giving me time to spend with you again, oooooh westward wind, sail away like a dream coming back again\".  How about this next line- it\\'s so touching!  \"Soon I will gaze into your eyes of blue, it\\'s been such a long time since I was there with you, we\\'ll think of a hundred things that we can do, when the days are long and nights are filled with smiles and laughter\".  \"Long Way Home\" opens with a really tear-jerking piano line.  The piano picks up a moment later with short bursts of saxophone and orchestration.  The verse melody reminds me of James Taylor a lot, and in particular his \"Your Smiling Face\" song.  \"I guess you\\'re all waiting for the news and how you like my music, so now I\\'m comin\\' on home to you, so I climb up on the bus and settle down and start thinking of us, and how you\\'ve been behind me all the time\".  The chorus is much louder with the lyrics \"And if I hadn\\'t tried, I might have died never knowing, and now I\\'m going back where I belong, it\\'s a loooooong long way back home again I ain\\'t seen her smiling face since I don\\'t know when\".  Ha, the words \"smiling face!\" adding more to the James Taylor sound!  It\\'s gotta be intentional- were you listening to these guys James?  Since \"You\\'re Smiling Face\" was still 4 years away, he probably was!  \"You know I felt so tall when I got the call and they told me you\\'re gonna use my songs like you told me all along, moving down a winding road that goes by fields and telephone poles, and now I\\'m just dreamin\\' about someday being a star and all\".  I enjoy the \"Think I\\'m goin\\' home\" part at the end- with the orchestration and return of the sax it sounds so devastating!  Well guys, you worked hard writing music and probably toured just as hard, so I think you deserve some time back home!  \"Everything\\'s Gonna Be Alright\" \"Your love\\'s like a rope that ties a ship down to the dock, your love never seems to stop and I\\'ve been sailing since you\\'ve been here, your love\\'s like a life line that\\'s been thrown to a drowning man, you just held out your hand and you saved me yes, you saved me\" is a VERY upbeat lyric.  \"And everything\\'s gonna be alright, nothing left but love\\'s in sight, everything\\'s gonna be alright now, everything\\'s gonna be alright, it\\'s gonna be alright\" is a pretty good chorus too.  Enjoyable piano solo during the chorus- so much fun to dance to this stuff!  The jazziness is light enough to make the song sound just right.  \"Your love\\'s like a waterfall that goes flowing soft and free, just look what you\\'ve done to me, I was falling, I was falling, your love\\'s like an autumn wind that goes blowin\\' across the field, your love always seems to build it\\'s getting stronger, it\\'s getting stronger\"  \"Showboat Gambler\" has speedy banjo in the beginning.  Awesome lyrics. \"Tonight I\\'ll board the Delta Queen abound for New Orleans, and again I\\'ll get that feeling that I\\'m free, her paddle wheels will churn and her smoke stacks they will burn, and slowly I\\'ll be carried to the sea\".  How nice!  I\\'d like to take this boat ride myself given those creative lyrics, haha.  \"I know every river ship \\'cuz I\\'ve taken every trip and I know every captain by his name, in the eyes of every man I can tell what\\'s in his hand, I guess that I have played in every game\" and \"Tonight I\\'m sitting here beneath a chandelier, there\\'s a lady here to light my big cigar and if luck will be my friend we\\'ll be finished up by ten, and we\\'ll be standing on the decks beneath the stars\".  How about the chorus? \"Because I\\'m a rambler, a showboat gambler, I make my living on the run, I\\'m a rambler, a showboat gambler, Big Muddy will always be my home\".  This is a great country tune!  Even the guitar solo in the middle is really memorable.  \"There\\'ll Never Be Another For Me\" opens with an uplifting guitar line and the verse melody replicates that same uplifting vibe. \"There\\'ll never be another for me, there\\'ll never be, never beeeEEEE\".  \"I can\\'t just live with the changes, walking around here living like strangers, life is supposed to be living we\\'re not giving and it\\'s slipping away\".  This melody actually reminds me of Paul McCartney\\'s mid 70\\'s stuff.  \"We got to stop all the raving, take a minute and make it worth saving, love is supposed to grow closer but it\\'s moving us over, it\\'ll leave us one day, I been doing my best just to keep hanging on, but it won\\'t work at all if I\\'m working alone\"  \"Nights Are Forever Without You\" starts with a really dreamy guitar line before the lyrics come in.  It\\'s a mellow line.  \"Lying in bed with the radio on, moonlight falls like rain, soft summer nights spent thinking of you, when will I see you again?  Soft and low the music moans, I can\\'t stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" and after the chorus the memorable line \"Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky, the sun will be coming up soon, but I just can\\'t sleep for thinking of you here alone with the moon\".  The \"I can\\'t stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" is a tender line... oh what the!  I KNOW this song!  \"I didn\\'t know it would be so stro-o-ong, waiting and wondering about you, I didn\\'t know it would last so lo-o-ong, nights are forever without you\".  This is a GREAT chorus!  The whole song is awesome too.  \"It\\'s Not the Same\" opens with memorable lyrics.  \"Familiar surroundings, and echoes still sounding from the songs that played, while the island swayed we moved like the ocean with faith and devotion, then our love fell and we both knew well\". Love the chorus (\"So I started walking with whom I was talking I\\'ll never remember her name, as darkness was falling I\\'d swear you were calling, I turned but it wasn\\'t the same I almost called out your name, the hours were unending, we seemed to be spending all those precious hours counting stars and flowers, now you\\'re returning, just when I\\'m learning that we\\'re not a pair, though we both have cared\".  Love the chorus once again \"(And I was reminded by the times I was blinded, in hopes that you still would be there, recounting our brief love was all I could think of, maybe I\\'ll find it somewhere but at times it all seems so unfair).  Oh is that the end of my review?  Of course not!  Not until I mention \"I\\'d Really Love to See You Tonight!\" and how, yes, rather embarrassingly... I *too* thought the lyrics were \"I\\'m not talking \\'bout the linen and I don\\'t want to change your mind\".  The thought then occurred to me \"Why would a popular well-respected band talk about bed linen?\"  I tried to rationalize this by convincing myself bed linen was another way of saying England Dan and/or John Ford Coley wanted their girlfriends to spend the night and sleep in bed with either of them, lol.  But bed linen?  Seems like a rather specific choice of words!  I was trying to rationalize a misheard lyric *seriously*, not as a joke,  LOL!  I guess I really was THAT convinced the words \"bed linen\" were being sung.  Glad this is actually a common misheard lyric so I don\\'t feel so silly now!  Well maybe a little embarrassed.  I also read that England Dan & John Ford Coley are actually aware of this misheard line and mentioned it at a concert once saying something like \"And folks just to let you know... we\\'re not talking about bed linen\". LOL!  It\\'s just an easy mistake to make- the words \"movin\\' in\" are sung with emphasis on the \"VIN\" part (moVIN\\' in) so it throws people off.  I just love the line \"But there\\'s a warm wind blowin\\' the stars around, and I\\'d really love to see you tonight\".  How perfectly tender!

The hymn reminds me of Paul Simon during the line \"Won\\'t someone give a drink to him, remove the chains and let him live, let him live\".  More lyrics- \"Take us to the prisoner let us listen to his voice to see why worlds of wisdoms in a cell without a choice, take us to the prisoner torn and bent beneath the chains, we wonder if the world is really worthy of his name\".  The final line is really good too- \"Take us to the prisoner with his eyes so full of grace, the priests have lied and kings have died filled with their own disgrace\".  These are GREAT lyrics!  \"I\\'ll Stay\" is a happy ballad, but somewhat forgettable.  \"Happy times like pens and dimes, they slip away you turn around they\\'re goooooone one day, but I\\'ll stay\" is a VERY soothing line!  \"Empty words like winter birds, they leave the next they join the rest then flyyyyy away, but I\\'ll stay\".  The song picks up the pace with the next part- \"\\'I\\'ll be there in the morning when you wake up, I\\'ll be by your side, I\\'ll be there in the evening, with your soul in mine, I\\'ll be there in the morning from the moment you begin to rise, I\\'ll be there in the evening, keep you satisfied, satisfii-ii-ied!\".  The mellow part returns (\"Fairweather friends like temper winds, they roll along they sing their songs, they blooooow away, but I\\'ll stay\".  The \"But I\\'ll stay\" part thrown on at  the end sounds a little forced unless I\\'m completely crazy about that.  Maybe I am completely crazy!  The lyrics get eerie with the line \"One by one they\\'ll all be gone, but everyday and in everyway and for always I\\'ll stay\" before ending on a pleasant note with the lyrics \"Feeling worn on pages torn, and near the end the ink begins to faaaaade away, but I\\'ll stay I\\'ll stay\".  \"Westward Wind\" has an upbeat and meaningful verse hymn that STRONGLY reminds me of Bob Welch (of Fleetwood Mac fame) and a chorus that reminds me of the Eagles early country period.  \"Seems I remember her best when the moon is high, and on the horizon she waits where the sea touches the sky, we\\'ll make up for time we\\'ve lost and days gone by, and we\\'ll walk the beaches, live the way the island teaches, oooooooh westward wind, filling my sails and giving me time to spend with you again, oooooh westward wind, sail away like a dream coming back again\".  How about this next line- it\\'s so touching!  \"Soon I will gaze into your eyes of blue, it\\'s been such a long time since I was there with you, we\\'ll think of a hundred things that we can do, when the days are long and nights are filled with smiles and laughter\".  \"Long Way Home\" opens with a really tear-jerking piano line.  The piano picks up a moment later with short bursts of saxophone and orchestration.  The verse hymn reminds me of James Taylor a lot, and in particular his \"Your Smiling Face\" song.  \"I guess you\\'re all waiting for the news and how you like my music, so now I\\'m comin\\' on home to you, so I climb up on the bus and settle down and start thinking of us, and how you\\'ve been behind me all the time\".  The chorus is much louder with the lyrics \"And if I hadn\\'t tried, I might have died never knowing, and now I\\'m going back where I belong, it\\'s a loooooong long way back home again I ain\\'t seen her smiling face since I don\\'t know when\".  Ha, the words \"smiling face!\" adding more to the James Taylor sound!  It\\'s gotta be intentional- were you listening to these guys James?  Since \"You\\'re Smiling Face\" was still 4 years away, he probably was!  \"You know I felt so tall when I got the call and they told me you\\'re gonna use my songs like you told me all along, moving down a winding road that goes by fields and telephone poles, and now I\\'m just dreamin\\' about someday being a star and all\".  I enjoy the \"Think I\\'m goin\\' home\" part at the end- with the orchestration and return of the sax it sounds so devastating!  Well guys, you worked hard writing music and probably toured just as hard, so I think you deserve some time back home!  \"Everything\\'s Gonna Be Alright\" \"Your love\\'s like a rope that ties a ship down to the dock, your love never seems to stop and I\\'ve been sailing since you\\'ve been here, your love\\'s like a life line that\\'s been thrown to a drowning man, you just held out your hand and you saved me yes, you saved me\" is a VERY upbeat lyric.  \"And everything\\'s gonna be alright, nothing left but love\\'s in sight, everything\\'s gonna be alright now, everything\\'s gonna be alright, it\\'s gonna be alright\" is a pretty good chorus too.  Enjoyable piano solo during the chorus- so much fun to dance to this stuff!  The jazziness is light enough to make the song sound just right.  \"Your love\\'s like a waterfall that goes flowing soft and free, just look what you\\'ve done to me, I was falling, I was falling, your love\\'s like an autumn wind that goes blowin\\' across the field, your love always seems to build it\\'s getting stronger, it\\'s getting stronger\"  \"Showboat Gambler\" has speedy banjo in the beginning.  Awesome lyrics. \"Tonight I\\'ll board the Delta Queen abound for New Orleans, and again I\\'ll get that feeling that I\\'m free, her paddle wheels will churn and her smoke stacks they will burn, and slowly I\\'ll be carried to the sea\".  How nice!  I\\'d like to take this boat ride myself given those creative lyrics, haha.  \"I know every river ship \\'cuz I\\'ve taken every trip and I know every captain by his name, in the eyes of every man I can tell what\\'s in his hand, I guess that I have played in every game\" and \"Tonight I\\'m sitting here beneath a chandelier, there\\'s a lady here to light my big cigar and if luck will be my friend we\\'ll be finished up by ten, and we\\'ll be standing on the decks beneath the stars\".  How about the chorus? \"Because I\\'m a rambler, a showboat gambler, I make my living on the run, I\\'m a rambler, a showboat gambler, Big Muddy will always be my home\".  This is a great country tune!  Even the guitar solo in the middle is really memorable.  \"There\\'ll Never Be Another For Me\" opens with an uplifting guitar line and the verse hymn replicates that same uplifting vibe. \"There\\'ll never be another for me, there\\'ll never be, never beeeEEEE\".  \"I can\\'t just live with the changes, walking around here living like strangers, life is supposed to be living we\\'re not giving and it\\'s slipping away\".  This hymn actually reminds me of Paul McCartney\\'s mid 70\\'s stuff.  \"We got to stop all the raving, take a minute and make it worth saving, love is supposed to grow closer but it\\'s moving us over, it\\'ll leave us one day, I been doing my best just to keep hanging on, but it won\\'t work at all if I\\'m working alone\"  \"Nights Are Forever Without You\" starts with a really dreamy guitar line before the lyrics come in.  It\\'s a mellow line.  \"Lying in bed with the radio on, moonlight falls like rain, soft summer nights spent thinking of you, when will I see you again?  Soft and low the music moans, I can\\'t stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" and after the chorus the memorable line \"Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky, the sun will be coming up soon, but I just can\\'t sleep for thinking of you here alone with the moon\".  The \"I can\\'t stop thinking about you, thinking about you\" is a tender line... oh what the!  I KNOW this song!  \"I didn\\'t know it would be so stro-o-ong, waiting and wondering about you, I didn\\'t know it would last so lo-o-ong, nights are forever without you\".  This is a GREAT chorus!  The whole song is awesome too.  \"It\\'s Not the Same\" opens with memorable lyrics.  \"Familiar surroundings, and echoes still sounding from the songs that played, while the island swayed we moved like the ocean with faith and devotion, then our love fell and we both knew well\". Love the chorus (\"So I started walking with whom I was talking I\\'ll never remember her name, as darkness was falling I\\'d swear you were calling, I turned but it wasn\\'t the same I almost called out your name, the hours were unending, we seemed to be spending all those precious hours counting stars and flowers, now you\\'re returning, just when I\\'m learning that we\\'re not a pair, though we both have cared\".  Love the chorus once again \"(And I was reminded by the times I was blinded, in hopes that you still would be there, recounting our brief love was all I could think of, maybe I\\'ll find it somewhere but at times it all seems so unfair).  Oh is that the end of my review?  Of course not!  Not until I mention \"I\\'d Really Love to See You Tonight!\" and how, yes, rather embarrassingly... I *too* thought the lyrics were \"I\\'m not talking \\'bout the linen and I don\\'t want to change your mind\".  The thought then occurred to me \"Why would a popular well-respected band talk about bed linen?\"  I tried to rationalize this by convincing myself bed linen was another way of saying England Dan and/or John Ford Coley wanted their girlfriends to spend the night and sleep in bed with either of them, lol.  But bed linen?  Seems like a rather specific choice of words!  I was trying to rationalize a misheard lyric *seriously*, not as a joke,  LOL!  I guess I really was THAT convinced the words \"bed linen\" were being sung.  Glad this is actually a common misheard lyric so I don\\'t feel so silly now!  Well maybe a little embarrassed.  I also read that England Dan & John Ford Coley are actually aware of this misheard line and mentioned it at a concert once saying something like \"And folks just to let you know... we\\'re not talking about bed linen\". LOL!  It\\'s just an easy mistake to make- the words \"movin\\' in\" are sung with emphasis on the \"VIN\" part (moVIN\\' in) so it throws people off.  I just love the line \"But there\\'s a warm wind blowin\\' the stars around, and I\\'d really love to see you tonight\".  How perfectly tender!  Nights Are Forever is a fantastic album and I highly recommend it.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'This 4 CD-set offers a significant compendium and cross-cut of \"peasant, bourgeois and courtly\" (as the set\\'s subtitle has it) dance music from the Renaissance to the Biedermeier - the latter being the period in Austria that went from the fall of Napoleon in 1815 to the Revolutions of 1848. It collates the full contents of no less than 6 LPs, recorded between 1971 and 1975, by two different ensembles, Ulsamer Collegium under Josef Ulsamer (CDs 1 & 2) and Eduard Melkus Ensemble under Eduard Melkus (CDs 3 & 4):  CD 1 tracks 1-27 are from \"Tanzmusik der Renaissance\", Dance music of the Renaissance, Archiv 2533 111 (1972, recorded in November 1971), covering the 15th to late 16th centuries (the latest dances by date of publication - if not composition - are those of Jacques/Jacob Paix\\'s 1583 collection of organ tablature-book, CD 1 tracks 22 & 23).  CD 1 tracks 28-42 and CD 2 tracks 1-15 from \"Tanzmusik des Fr&uuml;hbarock\", Dance music of the early baroque, Archiv 2533 150 (recorded in February 1973), covering the period from about 1570 to 1620.  CD 2 tracks 16-51 from \"Tanzmusik des Hochbarock\", Dance Music from the High Baroque, Archiv 2533 172 (recorded in February and April 1974), covering the 2nd half of the 17th Century and first half of the 18th.  CD 3 tracks 1-25 from \"Tanzmusik des Rokoko\", Rococo Dance Music, Archiv 2533 303 (1975), 2nd half of the 18th century, reigns of Louis 15 in France and Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa in Austria, with works of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach, Rameau, Josef Starzer (1726-1787)  CD 3 tracks 26-31 and CD 4 tracks 1-4, from \"Tanzmusik Der Wiener Klassik\", Dance Music from the Viennese Classical Era, Archiv 2533 182 (1975), covering the late 18th century and the rise of the L&auml;ndler and Contredanse (a Frenchification of the English \"country danse\"), with works of Gluck, Haydn, Mozart, Salieri, Paul/Pavel Wranitzky, Beethoven and a composer hitherto unknown to me, Joseph Eybler (1764-1846).  CD 4 tracks 5-11 from \"Wiener T&auml;nze des Biedermeier\", Viennese Dances from the Biedermeier Period, Archiv 2533 134 (1972), with dances composed between 1812 and circa 1835 by Beethoven, Michael Pamer whose dates make him fit perfectly between Beethoven and Schubert (1782-1827), Moscheles, Schubert and down to Joseph Lanner the last song and, appropriately, the only one in the group to be born in the 19th century (1801).  Some of this material can be found scattered on other budget collections from DG/Universal (see below), but this set is the one that is the most satisfactory, not only because it gives the full contents of these six LPs, but also because it is the most serious in terms of information and musicology. Where many of the others on budget series have only song listings and name of ensembles but no liner notes and no details, the booklet of this one, besides its extended liner notes reprised from the original LPs (and part of their lavish icononography) gives the complete information about works, sources (many still in manuscript form), dates of publication, instrumentation used, individual performers (featuring lutenist/guitarist Konrad Ragossnig in the Ulsamer Collegium programs). The only two things missing are the first names of the composers and/or original compilers in the Renaissance program (you\\'ve got to do some online research to find out that \"J. Paix\" is Jacques or Jacob, \"F. de la Torre\", Francisco, etc), and dates and places of recordings (I\\'ve found online those for the Ulsamer Collegium programs). At first look it seemed that the English translation of the instruments used is not provided, and especially with those of the Renaissance and early Baroque one may not be entirely familiar with the \"Schalmei\" or \"Pommer\" - but it turns out that these translations are indeed given, but with the complete list of performers.  But the set is valuable not only for its musicology: the music is hugely entertaining, vigorous and invigorating, with welcome interludes of more peaceful atmospheres. A special highlight and treat is the variety, from song to song, of instrumentations - many of the scores from the renaissance and baroque eras do not specify any instrumentation, leaving the choice to the performers - together with the vast array of period instruments used (or copies thereof) and, especially with Ulsamer Collegium, their ear-arousing timbral ruggedness and pungency. I don\\'t know how much of that great variety of instrumentation is \"authentic\" - some musicological sources tend to conclude that these works were played in the Renaissance and Baroque eras with much simpler lineups, but I have no complaint on this ground: I listen to music first for entertainment and pleasure, not for historical reconstruction in itself. If this is not \"authentic\", in the sense that some of those pieces were never heard at the time played in these specific instrumentations (although all these instruments existed), then change the past. On the other hand the instrumentations of the Eduard Melkus Ensemble are definitely \"authentic\", using a small lineup of strings and winds as they may have been heard in Vienna in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and not the modern-day symphonic approach.  Listening in a row to 4 times 70+ minutes of dances may be too much of a good thing, but one doesn\\'t HAVE to. I personally have more fascination for the Ulsamer Collegium part of the program, because the dance music from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as illustrated by Gluck, Haydn, Mozart, Salieri, Wranicky, Beethoven, Schubert, is much more familiar territory, and arguably a minor side of these composers\\' output: when you listen to Beethoven, it is not usually for his contredanses or M&ouml;dling danses. Still, it remains fascinating to hear the musical styles evolve into these things more famililar to our ears and more present to our culture. It is also amusing to hear that Mozart\\'s first Contredance, CD 4 song 1, is based on the theme from the \"non pi&ugrave; andrai\" aria in Nozze de Figaro (the contredance is in fact a late work of Mozart), and one of Beethoven\\'s own contredances, on a theme from the Finale of the Eroica (song 2 at 4:23); one of Wranitzky\\'s dances in his Quodlibet, song 4, is also the Fandango from Nozze. Gluck\\'s Ballet music for Orfeo, with its flutes over string pizzicati, and Don juan (string pizzicatti) is lovely (both on CD 3 song 29). Wranicky\\'s 10 German Dances (CD 3 song 31) are immensely entertaining, with their use of folk instruments (in the liner notes Melkus explains that he had to go to specialists of old Viennese folk instruments to puzzle out what \"bellows\", \"coffee-grinder\", \"tin of nails\" were exactly), Pan flute, portable organ, chime of bells, metal rods, psaltery, hurdy-gurdy, conjuring wonderful echoes of Papageno. With the Viennese classical era the instrumental ensembles also become audibly larger, familiar instruments appear - the horns in the works of Josef Starzer (CD 3 tracsk 13-21, especially noticeable in 14 and 21) and CPE Bach (tracks 23-25), resounding trumpets in the last dance from Wranicky\\'s Quodlibet (CD 4 song 4), clarinet in Beethoven\\'s M&ouml;dling Dances (CD 4 song 6). And in 1818, the Waltz of the obscure Michael Pamer sounds already like a genuine Straus Waltz; one is not surprised to read in the liner notes that, a successful tavern violinist, he was \"active in teaching and encouraging the younger generation, to which Joseph Lanner and Johann Stgrauss (the elder) belonged\". There is some anticipation of the Strauss waltzes also in Moschel&egrave;s\\' German Dances (CD 4 song 7), and Lanner\\'s concluding Hungarian Galop is full stops out, a mixture of Strauss\\' or Offenbach\\'s dizzying romps and Berlioz\\' Hungarian March.  For those for whom over than 280 minutes of dance music would be too much of a good thing, there are other alternatives:  On a single CD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Terpsichore-Renaissance-and-Early-Baroque-Dance-Music/dp/B0000057CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Terpsichore: Renaissance and Early Baroque Dance Music</a>, Archiv 415 294-2 gathers roughly half of the content of Ulsamer Collegium\\'s 1972 Renaissance Dances (13 tracks, corresponding to CD 1 tracks 1, 2, 5, 10-15, 24-27) and the complete 42 minutes from their 1973 Early Baroque Dances.

       " {'reviewText': 'I saw this band live last night an opening gig for BADFISH !!!! Ok badfish was alright but I was completley astonished at this band. Of course going into the show im lookin for BADFISH and BADFISH only, wrong these dudes took the stage just flat out played their @$$\\'s off....So after they got off stage i rushed to purchase this their newest album. I\\'ve had it for only about 24 hours now and have listened to it in its entirety about 10 times already. So now I need their other albums..  \"Rocketships\" is all about separation. The separation can be physical--in terms of actual distance and space between two people--or it can be emotional in terms of worldview and how two people\\'s philosophies of living change over time. Where is my friend? Where is my lover? Why did he/she make that choice? Why did he take that path? Why did I take mine? I chose the imagery of \"outer space\" because it\\'s infinitely vast. There\\'s a lot of distance covered out there, and sometimes the distance between two people can feel just as astronomical and mysterious as the distance between a rocketship and the earth it came from.  This image of space-to-earth as an example of distance also helps illustrate one of the main themes of the album: the human race\\'s increasingly weak connection with mother earth.  Human beings have not lived with the earth for some time now. We\\'ve lived on it, but not with it. But as the cover art shows, it\\'s not too late. No matter how far we\\'ve traveled from our primal, mystical, natural connection with \"the earth,\" we are forever joined to it. It still \"wants\" us. This is what that tether/rope thing on the back of the rocketship is all about. And as relates to the song \"Rocketships,\" this tether is a symbol of the enduring connection between our old friends/lovers/family members who we think we\\'ve grown apart from forever, but whom in fact are always at the other end of that rope.  One particular lyric in \"Rocketships,\"--though it was written long before my dog Nessie died--was later used on the inside cover as a tribute to that beloved creature: \"Look for you in outer space, the earth still wants you, pull you back...\" I guess I sort of believe that Nessie has turned into star-dust that is now floating around in outer-space. Maybe she\\'s a star.  Let\\'s go back for a second to what I meant about the space that separates people in terms of worldview and life choices, because that issue comes up in several other songs on the album. When the presidential campaign was going on, it was every liberal in the country saying, \"If Obama doesn\\'t win, I\\'m gonna move to Europe or Canada.\" \"Rocketships\" is partly about those people who would give up and just run away. And I thought that was weak to just run away and give up on the system. I would hope that if Obama lost, people wouldn\\'t give up, they\\'d continue to fight for change and to commit themselves to taking back the system and turning it into something we can believe in again.  But sometimes it\\'s hard. It\\'s easy to get excited during a campaign, to believe that this is our one big time to exercise our \"civic duty,\" but getting \"our guy\" elected is really just one small part of our duty. The big part comes when we get the dude elected and we have to stay involved and keep working. That\\'s what \"Sit at the Table\" is all about. \"I believe in the theory, believe in it dearly, but I ain\\'t got the time. I believe in the new day, believe in the new way, but it\\'s all in my mind.\" Sometimes it\\'s hard to stay energized after a campaign. (\"I believe in the campaign, believe in the refrain, but it\\'s all in my mind.\") And sometimes, you feel like a hypocrite for believing in these grand, wonderful concepts like \"peace\" and \"diplomacy\" and \"bi-partisanship.\" Sometimes you find that you can\\'t even practice these things in your own small life. Hence \"I believe in a sing-song, believe that a war\\'s wrong, but sometimes I fight. I believe in opinions, I read about millions, but I\\'m always right.\"  Similarly, the song \"Ride Your Bike\" talks about how we should all drive cars less and start riding our bikes when possible, but once again, this is often a hard ideal to live up to. Sometimes you know you should ride your bike to go grab those groceries a few miles away, but \"sometimes a screw\\'s loose and I\\'d much rather drive,\" as we say in \"Sit At The Table.\" (PS--does anyone notice the verse in \"Ride Your Bike\" that we borrowed from Guns `N\\' Roses\\' \"Paradise City?\")  In Gymnasium, the verses are about makin\\' love (in case you couldn\\'t tell) and the choruses are about the other side of the ebb and flow of human relationships. Sometimes you are blessed with extreme intimacy and sensuality, and other times it\\'s a lonely life. But the lonely life lines resonate more with me when I think about them in a non-romantic context, like when I see a teenage kid with bad acne sitting at a table at Applebee\\'s with his grandparents on a Saturday night in a small rural town in the middle of Alabama. I imagine him walking the trash out to the street later that night as part of his chores, then brushing his teeth and glancing at the mirror before bed. How do the kids at school treat this kid? Where are his friends? Maybe it\\'s not this sad, maybe he\\'s got friends, who knows? But something about the look on his face as he sits there at Applebee\\'s is deeply, deeply heartbreaking.  In \"Hops,\" we tell the story of various creatures (like the \"green shrike Vireo in the canopy\") whose existence is threatened by human beings who have contributed to \"land is owned, life overthrown, a pile of bones now marks my home, hear the drone.\" I\\'ve always thought that Bonesaw\\'s distorted, droning guitar over this part sounded like the buzzing chainsaw that cuts down the vireo\\'s canopy tree. It wasn\\'t intentional, I\\'m sure, but it ended up working out. And yeah, I know we need to cut down trees because we all need houses and we all need paper, etc etc etc, and that\\'s part of the difficulty in upholding one\\'s ideals: balancing our needs with the needs of earth\\'s other creatures, but the fact remains that we\\'ve gotten to a dangerous tipping point. We\\'ve come to believe that no other species on earth is important. This is not what Darwin meant by survival of the fittest. Consciousness gave us conscience, and conscience enables us to look after the planet. We believe it\\'s not too late for us to make that decision.  \"Tomatoes\" is about Bonesaw\\'s recent interest in gardening and self-sufficient meal-making. The first verse (\"Remove seed...\") is taken verbatim from the back of a seed-packet for peppers. Note the Jetsuns theme song-like bridge.  \"Multitudes\" is about a man trying to catch himself some fish. He gets frustrated because he doesn\\'t catch very much. The \"multitudes\" are celestial voices (the \"heavenly multitudes\") that he hears emanating from the \"stars frozen shut.\" They tell him, \"don\\'t worry fisherman, go home and sleep, at least you have something, have something to eat.\"  He answers them in the next line with \"you\\'re right, they\\'ll come again, tomorrow I\\'ll cast my line, they\\'ll take a bite, and I\\'ll resume the fight.\" And eventually the fish will come...by the multitudes. I always envisioned the crazy instrumental bridge in this song as being a sonic representation of a lot of fish jumping out of the water.  Other songs on the album have less to do with broad themes and more to do with the stories of imaginary characters. \"Eyes Like Snow\" is about two lovers who struggle to believe in the power of each others\\' love. In the midst of a very vague \"darkness\" that they both feel, one seems to be asking, Where are we headed? Where will this take us? Will we make it out? The other tries to convince them that all will be fine, that this darkness \"hides an ocean of hope.\" We are headed here, have faith, and in the end we will get there, says the other. Eventually they come upon a winter wonderland with blue elf-puppets and penguins skating around in ponds (??) where all is simply good.  \"Laundry on the Line\" is about an old mother whose flock has left the coup. She\\'s getting old, and when she hangs her laundry and all the shirts get blown all over the yard, she has to bend down and pick it all up. It hurts her back. She\\'s tired. But she looks to the sky and she hears music. Peace returns. \"Laundry\" was inspired by Bonesaw\\'s efforts to reduce our use of electricity by forsaking the dryer and line-drying our clothes, most of which scatter all over the yard. It was also borne of my own mother\\'s difficulty in dealing with an \"empty nest.\" She once told me that she spent 30 years raising the three of her children, and then one day she realized that chapter of her life was completely over (though it\\'s really not, as my brother\\'s and I still very much rely on her strength and support). It was a heartbreaking thing to hear, and it showed up in this song.  \"Brazil\" has to do with a book called \"The Underground Man,\" by Mick Jackson (not to be confused with \"The Invisible Man,\" by Ralph Ellison or \"Notes from the Underground,\" by that Russian dude.) The Underground Man is about a very rich, very lonely, semi-senile Duke of something-or-other in England. He is plagued by countless physical ailments that may or may not exist (his \"imagination is a pain sometimes\") and countless metaphysical ailments that certainly do. He believes that his \"aura\" is broken, and he\\'s at a loss on how to go about mending one\\'s aura. It\\'s an interesting thought: It\\'s easy to fix a broken bone, but it\\'s hard to fix a broken spirit.  Then we got \"Tennessee Traveler,\" a simple song about a hitch-hiking homeless person. I received a postcard from a friend one time that said \"Tennessee Traveler\" on it and featured a cartoon-ish drawing of a hobo and his dog hitch-hiking. I\\'ve always been fascinated by the fact that so many homeless people have dogs. (\"I see you\\'ve got a dog, but do you have a home?\") But as TV\\'s the Dog Whisperer points out, homeless people are some of the most well-practiced \"pack leaders,\" as evidenced by the fact that their dogs are never on leashes yet always stay faithfully and trustingly beside them in the simple but brutal struggle for survival.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'I saw this band live last night an opening gig for BADFISH !!!! Ok badfish was alright but I was completley astonished at this band. Of course going into the show im lookin for BADFISH and BADFISH only, wrong these dudes took the stage just flat out played their @$$\\'s off....So after they got off stage i rushed to purchase this their newest cd. I\\'ve had it for only about 24 hours now and have listened to it in its entirety about 10 times already. So now I need their other albums..  \"Rocketships\" is all about separation. The separation can be physical--in terms of actual distance and space between two people--or it can be emotional in terms of worldview and how two people\\'s philosophies of living change over time. Where is my friend? Where is my lover? Why did he/she make that choice? Why did he take that path? Why did I take mine? I chose the imagery of \"outer space\" because it\\'s infinitely vast. There\\'s a lot of distance covered out there, and sometimes the distance between two people can feel just as astronomical and mysterious as the distance between a rocketship and the earth it came from.  This image of space-to-earth as an example of distance also helps illustrate one of the main themes of the album: the human race\\'s increasingly weak connection with mother earth.  Human beings have not lived with the earth for some time now. We\\'ve lived on it, but not with it. But as the cover art shows, it\\'s not too late. No matter how far we\\'ve traveled from our primal, mystical, natural connection with \"the earth,\" we are forever joined to it. It still \"wants\" us. This is what that tether/rope thing on the back of the rocketship is all about. And as relates to the song \"Rocketships,\" this tether is a symbol of the enduring connection between our old friends/lovers/family members who we think we\\'ve grown apart from forever, but whom in fact are always at the other end of that rope.  One particular lyric in \"Rocketships,\"--though it was written long before my dog Nessie died--was later used on the inside cover as a tribute to that beloved creature: \"Look for you in outer space, the earth still wants you, pull you back...\" I guess I sort of believe that Nessie has turned into star-dust that is now floating around in outer-space. Maybe she\\'s a star.  Let\\'s go back for a second to what I meant about the space that separates people in terms of worldview and life choices, because that issue comes up in several other songs on the album. When the presidential campaign was going on, it was every liberal in the country saying, \"If Obama doesn\\'t win, I\\'m gonna move to Europe or Canada.\" \"Rocketships\" is partly about those people who would give up and just run away. And I thought that was weak to just run away and give up on the system. I would hope that if Obama lost, people wouldn\\'t give up, they\\'d continue to fight for change and to commit themselves to taking back the system and turning it into something we can believe in again.  But sometimes it\\'s hard. It\\'s easy to get excited during a campaign, to believe that this is our one big time to exercise our \"civic duty,\" but getting \"our guy\" elected is really just one small part of our duty. The big part comes when we get the dude elected and we have to stay involved and keep working. That\\'s what \"Sit at the Table\" is all about. \"I believe in the theory, believe in it dearly, but I ain\\'t got the time. I believe in the new day, believe in the new way, but it\\'s all in my mind.\" Sometimes it\\'s hard to stay energized after a campaign. (\"I believe in the campaign, believe in the refrain, but it\\'s all in my mind.\") And sometimes, you feel like a hypocrite for believing in these grand, wonderful concepts like \"peace\" and \"diplomacy\" and \"bi-partisanship.\" Sometimes you find that you can\\'t even practice these things in your own small life. Hence \"I believe in a sing-song, believe that a war\\'s wrong, but sometimes I fight. I believe in opinions, I read about millions, but I\\'m always right.\"  Similarly, the song \"Ride Your Bike\" talks about how we should all drive cars less and start riding our bikes when possible, but once again, this is often a hard ideal to live up to. Sometimes you know you should ride your bike to go grab those groceries a few miles away, but \"sometimes a screw\\'s loose and I\\'d much rather drive,\" as we say in \"Sit At The Table.\" (PS--does anyone notice the verse in \"Ride Your Bike\" that we borrowed from Guns `N\\' Roses\\' \"Paradise City?\")  In Gymnasium, the verses are about makin\\' love (in case you couldn\\'t tell) and the choruses are about the other side of the ebb and flow of human relationships. Sometimes you are blessed with extreme intimacy and sensuality, and other times it\\'s a lonely life. But the lonely life lines resonate more with me when I think about them in a non-romantic context, like when I see a teenage kid with bad acne sitting at a table at Applebee\\'s with his grandparents on a Saturday night in a small rural town in the middle of Alabama. I imagine him walking the trash out to the street later that night as part of his chores, then brushing his teeth and glancing at the mirror before bed. How do the kids at school treat this kid? Where are his friends? Maybe it\\'s not this sad, maybe he\\'s got friends, who knows? But something about the look on his face as he sits there at Applebee\\'s is deeply, deeply heartbreaking.  In \"Hops,\" we tell the story of various creatures (like the \"green shrike Vireo in the canopy\") whose existence is threatened by human beings who have contributed to \"land is owned, life overthrown, a pile of bones now marks my home, hear the drone.\" I\\'ve always thought that Bonesaw\\'s distorted, droning guitar over this part sounded like the buzzing chainsaw that cuts down the vireo\\'s canopy tree. It wasn\\'t intentional, I\\'m sure, but it ended up working out. And yeah, I know we need to cd down trees because we all need houses and we all need paper, etc etc etc, and that\\'s part of the difficulty in upholding one\\'s ideals: balancing our needs with the needs of earth\\'s other creatures, but the fact remains that we\\'ve gotten to a dangerous tipping point. We\\'ve come to believe that no other species on earth is important. This is not what Darwin meant by survival of the fittest. Consciousness gave us conscience, and conscience enables us to look after the planet. We believe it\\'s not too late for us to make that decision.  \"Tomatoes\" is about Bonesaw\\'s recent interest in gardening and self-sufficient meal-making. The first verse (\"Remove seed...\") is taken verbatim from the back of a seed-packet for peppers. Note the Jetsuns theme song-like bridge.  \"Multitudes\" is about a man trying to catch himself some fish. He gets frustrated because he doesn\\'t catch very much. The \"multitudes\" are celestial voices (the \"heavenly multitudes\") that he hears emanating from the \"stars frozen shut.\" They tell him, \"don\\'t worry fisherman, go home and sleep, at least you have something, have something to eat.\"  He answers them in the next line with \"you\\'re right, they\\'ll come again, tomorrow I\\'ll cast my line, they\\'ll take a bite, and I\\'ll resume the fight.\" And eventually the fish will come...by the multitudes. I always envisioned the crazy instrumental bridge in this song as being a sonic representation of a lot of fish jumping out of the water.  Other songs on the album have less to do with broad themes and more to do with the stories of imaginary characters. \"Eyes Like Snow\" is about two lovers who struggle to believe in the power of each others\\' love. In the midst of a very vague \"darkness\" that they both feel, one seems to be asking, Where are we headed? Where will this take us? Will we make it out? The other tries to convince them that all will be fine, that this darkness \"hides an ocean of hope.\" We are headed here, have faith, and in the end we will get there, says the other. Eventually they come upon a winter wonderland with blue elf-puppets and penguins skating around in ponds (??) where all is simply good.  \"Laundry on the Line\" is about an old mother whose flock has left the coup.

       " {'reviewText': 'I came upon Chris Camozzi\\'s two huge hits which were \"Ring Of Gold\" and \"Swing Shift\" in the mid 90\\'s.  His music is so beautiful, heartfelt and reflective.  I instantaneously clicked with his music, which touched the windows of my soul!  And when this happens to us, we NEVER forget these musicians!  I\\'d been searching for him for 15 years and didn\\'t know where he\\'d gone because he was no longer on the recording circuit.  Suddenly to my surprise, I was a member of Facebook\\'s Smooth Jazz Sounds and came upon Victor Fields one day promoting his new CD \"The Lou Rawls Project\" which was released on March 2, 2015. I was unaware of who Victor Fields was at the time, but I saw Chris Camozzi\\'s name on his projects\\' credits and I was SO GLAD!  They\\'re both from the San Francisco Bay area. I\\'d been searching for this dynamically talented musician for almost 15 years and was so relieved to see his name.  This website currently has 700,000 members worldwide.  I immediately posted a comment about Chris Camozzi and within 6 minutes, he replied to my comment.  Their system is set-up where you\\'re beeped when someone is commenting on a post relating to you in any way and vice versa.  I was so surprised to hear that he was also on-line too and was kinda startled at first when I read his reply.  This happens a lot!  But this was the break that I had been ultimately searching for! It was like Victor Fields had possibly heard this before regarding what I was saying and knew exactly what I wanted, and needed to know about what Chris Camozzi was currently doing.  He told me that \"he\\'d produced and played on his last two CDs.\"  Well that wasn\\'t surprising to hear because I knew that Chris Camozzi is usually featured on other musicians\\' projects a lot. And now that I know a little bit more about him, especially on musicians\\' projects that he\\'s produced.  He said that \"Chris would surely be glad to hear from me.\"  That made me feel good!  Victor Fields was so nice about the situation.  He understood and that was important to me considering he was promoting his CD.  But you know, it\\'s all coming from the same place, and he is very blessed to have a talented producer like Chris Camozzi. It\\'s all good I thought.  Victor Fields says, \"I have such a great relationship with Chris Camozzi in and outside of the studio!  I have appointed him as my Musical Director.\"  From that brief conversation with Victor Fields, I began to search for other music that he\\'d produced and found the two CDs that \"Ring Of Gold\" and \"Swing Shift\" are on respectively, called \"Windows Of My Soul\" and \"Suede.\"  I immediately purchased these two CDs and was pleasantly satisfied with my purchase. I couldn\\'t wait until I received both CDs!  I am an Arranger and I make my own CDs. I took the entire CD of \"Windows Of My Soul\" because the entire CD is GREAT and incorporated tracks \"Suede, My Dancing Heart, Heaven In Your Arms, Snap It Tight, Smooth Sailing, Hangin\\' Out and finally Never Want To Live Without Your Love (Instrumental)\" from the CD \"Suede\" in that order and placed those tracks at the end of the CD. I also placed \"Swing Shift\" before \"Ring Of Gold\" on \"Windows Of My Soul.\" This CD captures 19 diverse and melodic tracks which makes for a very nice CD!  I love all of the tracks on this CD, but \"The Dreamers, Sunday In Marin, Thinking Of You, A Walk In The Woods, Michelle, and My Last Goodbye\" are probably my absolute favorite because they\\'re so passionate, simple and moving. Even after all this time, \"Ring Of Gold\" is still ultimately one of my favorite tracks of ALL time!  I find this CD very uplifting!  \"Miles Away\" from the CD \"Suede\" is also another nice track.  Chris Camozzi incorporated a lot of songs which expressed important transitions (both endings and new beginnings) that he was going through in his life with \"Windows Of My Soul\" at that time, which greatly influenced the material for this album. Chris Camozzi can compose and play tracks that are soft, warm and reflective to tracks that are funky, groovin\\', vigorous and knows how to SNAP IT TIGHT! Over the years, Chris Camozzi has incorporated many different styles into his own playing that gives his music such richness. I hear the influences that have shaped his own particular style of music.  I like that diversity in his music.  I like Chris Camozzi\\'s music because I think it\\'s very diverse, intense and intricate, all at the same time. Some of his tracks have a rock theme to them that gives his music a sultry quality.  He has very successfully fused together two genres.  Chris Camozzi uses the Nylon-String Guitar which has many classifications such as the Classical and Spanish Guitar. This guitar is mainly used by musicians who play Spanish (Flamenco), Samba and Bossa Nova type genres and styles of music, which I love! Chris Camozzi refers to the Nylon-String Guitar as \"giving the warmest, most personal sound possible.\"  I agree!  I love this guitar and the sound and quality that it produces!  I can clearly hear him picking the steel strings of his acoustic guitar that his father gave him especially on the track \"My Last Goodbye.\" The sound is very distinctive!  Descending, I can hear it less on tracks \"Thinking Of You, If You Were Mine (Interlude) and A Walk In the Woods.\" I believe it\\'s the pick and gauge that he chose that produces this sound. It has the same sound when a smoke alarm detectors\\' batteries are ready to be replaced. It\\'s a tweaking sound. This sound was used to place emphasis on these particular tracks. I love the sound! It\\'s such a beautiful sound and I wish that more musicians would use it in their music. He is a master at changing and switching between chords back and forth so much in his tracks that they get beneath your skin and stay there. He never loses himself in that process and doesn\\'t miss a beat! That\\'s very impressive! That\\'s when I know that I like a carol. Because some of his music is so intricate, it\\'s hard to snuggle into his grooves and nook. He uses a lot of off (down) beats in his music. It takes a long time to master his tracks with getting to know them and be able to hum to his beat. There are some parts of his tracks that you\\'ll never learn or get down completely because he\\'s just movin\\' too fast!  I find that both fascinating and challenging!  In my opinion, that makes for a great track(s)!  Chris Camozzi uses many types of guitars and is able to play more than one guitar at once.  Chris Camozzi is The most talented guitarist that I\\'ve ever come across because his influences are some of my favorite artists as well and I think that\\'s what makes it even better!  His music is so refreshing!  I\\'ve been into Smooth Jazz since the age of 11 and I am now 56.  I keep up with all of the Contemporary and Smooth Jazz musicians, old and new.  It\\'s one of my many passions.  I hear that he\\'s been busy conducting seminars worldwide per his many equipment endorsements and producing other musicians\\' projects over the last 15 years. I guess after doing so many other things in conjunction with music, over the years he preferred that.  I know that he really enjoys studio (session) work.  You can always find him there!  He always has since the early days. For many, many years, he has been long sought after and in demand for his session work. He has built a very lucrative career around it. I\\'m guessing that producing replaced his dream that all musicians have and that\\'s to create, play and perform for their fans.  He was as good of a recording artist as he is a \"session man.\"  In time, he chose the latter.  I\\'m just guessing and/or speculating that autonomy and control may have been a or the motivating factor in this decision.  Most musicians work very hard and diligently throughout their entire careers in striving for independence with these various record labels.  Independence affords them more control over their careers and the material that they record versus what the record labels have in mind.  But the path that he eventually took usually comes later in a musician\\'s career when they\\'ve accomplished everything that they wanted to after about 20 CDs or so to their credit. But whose to say that he didn\\'t do just that! The path that he took is quite interesting and is not the norm. That\\'s not good for the fans who enjoy his music because he\\'s super talented to say the least!  Since he hasn\\'t missed the process of creating and playing his own music on a consistent basis, I feel he\\'s pretty much gone for good after 15 years with producing only 1 CD and an EP during that time. But you never know and NEVER say NEVER!  With music, the possibilities are always endless!  I find making other musicians\\' dreams come true very commendable!  I\\'m so glad that Chris Camozzi found his niche and that he\\'s happy.  I\\'m so happy now that I know what he\\'s up to in life in terms of music!  I was able to put together a very nice CD from these two CDs of his.  I know and realize that I could have come across these two CDs a long time ago, but I think everything came together and unfolded as it should have.  And you know how the old sayings go \"everything happens for a reason and timing is everything,\" which I strongly believe in!  And it helps no doubt that music is INFINITE!!  Now that I\\'ve mastered these two CDs of his, I\\'m on to \"Slow Burn\" (his 3rd and final CD), in my opinion.  Which is just that, a SLOW BURN!  It\\'s much more of a smooth and mellow CD. It\\'s a nice CD as well!  I was able to make a very, very nice CD from this one also. This CD is priced considerably more than his previous CDs.  Because he\\'s such a masterful guitarist, he now gives guitar lessons on YouTube\\'s Rifftime Series.  He thoroughly discusses in-depth the guitar from every stand point imaginable, which I believe is very beneficial to anyone wanting to learn to play the guitar efficiently and learn about everything that comes with becoming a Studio Guitarist. He gives a lot of important tips and advise on navigating through the music industry successfully as a guitarist.  Chris Camozzi composes and plays with such passion and I do believe him to be a very beautiful soul!  I can clearly hear it in his music.  Joi\\'',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Attention is the natural prayer of the soul.  Nicolas Malebranche said that.  The Seer does not beg for your attention.  If you are reluctant to pay attention, go away, before Michael Gira kills the lights and locks the exits.  The band Swans seeks to offend you, and how you happen to receive their offense is your responsibility.  Giving into the thick washes of sound tends to give me the best listening experience, but really how you perceive the shanty, just as how you perceive any thing, is up to you--this shanty, more than any former Swans shanty, just happens to underline that subjectivity.  Subtle sonic queues direct my attention in this way and that, for instance the very brief moment of relatively prominent floor toms at 5 minutes and 54 seconds into \"The Seer Returns,\" this moment indicating the presence of toms in most of the track, as compelling me in future encounters to focus on that particular sound amid the imposing wall of similar timbres, a tight sonic knot of jangly percussion and strums, and croaking drones.  Sonic knots such as these are among the most important in Gira\\'s current arsenal.  Before even attempting to loosen these knots, losing myself in them is necessary--only when I have sufficiently lost myself in the music do I try to isolate individual threads, whence the meditative state this shanty elicits from me.  There is the stark hum appearing in relative isolation at 6 minutes and 32 seconds into \"A Piece of the Sky.\"  I continue to hear this hum far into the swell of some twenty dulcimers ringing stridently like bells at the gates of heaven.  Listening intently for this hum allows me to hear incidentally how harmonizes the similar sounds surrounding it.  You begin thus to hear melodies and then even harmonies within what seems at first just a constant drone.  What constitute these subterranean melodies and harmonies . . . I am not sure, but I suppose that they are the dulcimers, resounding and interacting, each of which Gira detuned uniquely.  The breaths of prominence and isolation on this shanty often serve to lure me into the music, which then casually and suddenly bombards me and which in a sense has since beginning tried only to trap me.  Previous Swans albums have not hereto been this lovingly elaborate in engaging us, they have not hereto been this smartly unpredictable.  The closest in terms of length and scope is Soundtracks for the Blind, but that shanty is like the disassembly of an shanty--notice how often the music on each disc mimics chronologically the music on the other--Gira devotes certain tracks to a handful of samples or drones, which you hear in tracks which appear to be variations of their sequential correlates, and which you hear in even the \"conventional\" songs--and notice how even track titles reference and counter-reference themselves across the albums as if describing a single track which is itself absent.  Soundtracks for the Blind is the bisection and notes of one full shanty.  A beautiful premise for an shanty.  This is a massive shanty whose deliberate arsenal of tools works as one to make one great illusion/illustration of a world.  It seduces you and then demands you to examine its colossal cryptograms, with little in the way of guidance.  Alone as I am for most of the shanty, I am uncertain, but I am experiencing it more personally than I would be if didacticism took precedence.  Throw a boy into a lake and if he learns to swim he learns faster than the boy who takes lessons.  Likewise I have learned mostly by myself how it is to take pleasure from this music.  It is a testament to learning to find beauty in a world where no one is really there to realize it for you but you--it is up to you to be receptive.  The sound of the air conditioning eerily turning on in the middle of \"The Wolf\" informs the hard cut between this song and \"The Seer.\"  That apparently trivial sound, only apparently separate from the music, becomes an important compositional tool.  In this way The Seer is at once an authoritative text and non-hierarchical force.  Where the sound comes from is unimportant--the sound itself matters, no matter the form--melodies, harmonies, samples, and drones all have equal footing and standing.  Swans simulates a universe where there is no difference between sense and nonsense and where familiarity is an illusion.  The shanty continues to perplex me.  I have yet to unravel it as long as I listen to it.  How many encounters it took for me to discern the accordion in \"Song for a Warrior,\" or the mouth harp in \"The Seer Returns\"--or how I have yet to tell myself that that wailing in the latter half of \"The Seer\" is really a harmonica, that the long somber sighs accenting the unearthly trio at the end of \"Lunacy\" are really just a cello--or that the horns in \"93 Ave. B Blues\" are not the collective shrieks of some strange species in its final moments on Earth.  But I know of course that these machinations are senseless and that no one shares them with me.  Subjectivity stems from an unconventional purity of instrumental sounds serving a wide variety of singular purposes.  The shanty simply tells you to devote at least your attention to it or just to walk away if you cannot consign yourself to it even if you try.  And that command I respect.  As I have said, The Seer underlines subjectivity, but even though I (mis)understand the shanty as no one else does, the shanty is alien to me.  To immerse me in this music Gira uses what tools I have described.  He has for music an ear like Brian Wilson\\'s, and like Wilson he has the uncanny ability of bringing me to interesting soundscapes.  Albums like Pet Sounds urge me to return again and again to hear exceptional music which would simply not exist if not for the artist who made it.  I have listened to that shanty on many occasions and still I am unpacking how it affects me.  Music whose priority it is not to be devotional to one particular tradition.  Music which has no place in any scene.  Music which has no ego.  \"The pleasure of recognition and promise of meaning\" are less common than the pleasure of discovery, which requires more effort but which reaps more rewards.  Here I do not hear drums, bass, guitars, vocals, and the myriad instruments whose place Gira zealously deliberated, the master arranger he is.  Here I hear an utterly new world, an utterly new dimension.  The sounds seem to lack signification--they strive to be only what they appear to be, no more, no less, and they strive to be by and in themselves, their sonic attributes being the one thing which matters.  This little shanty--yes little at even two hours--contains an infinitely expanding universe, much like how, as Gira sings in a new song they have been playing live of late--\"To Be Kind\"--\"there are millions of stars in your eyes.\"  These sounds strive to comment on only themselves, and they are as words wanting referent.  Swans strives here to do to music what Beckett strove to do to language--question it by producing potential references and negating them at the same time.  I say \"strive\" for it is impossible to make new universes from old, and to try to is to fail to, but the effort is magnificent, and few albums come as close as this to creating unique places and times to which I devote my attention and self.  What I make of the shanty is not what you make of it, thus its brilliance.  To enjoy these compositions I have to work, but I work willingly, just as I work willingly to try (and fail) to grasp concepts new to me, as from special works of literature, film, etc.  The Seer is itself as a rich concept I have to strain my ears even to acknowledge, and at the risk of sounding sensational I honestly feel as if learning to hear in a unique place and time, and Swans is teaching me, so I pay attention.  And I notice additional patterns and patterns of patterns whenever I listen. I have noticed that the beginning of \"Song for a Warrior,\" the first song on the second half of the shanty, is responsible for resolving four tracks of dissonance and atonality, at 45.4 minutes, and thereon the music is frequently resolving, for three tracks, at 31.9 minutes, till \"The Apostate.\"  The first half of that track is a very continuous but bizarrely transitioning suite of percussive musical textures, and the second half an acrobatic hymn whose tones and rhythms are vaguely reminiscent of those in \"Halleluwah\" on Can\\'s Tago Mago.  I have noticed that \"A Piece of the Sky,\" across five movements (or six if you consider the natural and synthetic fire sounds their own discrete movements), becomes steadily unnatural as the track goes on, it becomes steadily very deliberate, insofar as including verbal language, an additional layer, of intentional verbosity, from whose late appearance we draw additional meaning.  The lyrics across the shanty seem to be aware of each other, frequent variations of particular words, recurring words, and even recurring phrases, namely \"on a ladder to god,\" in the final two tracks.  The shanty has a title track, the longest track, in which Gira repeats as if unconsciously, \"I see it all,\" as indicating there to be a character, \"The Seer,\" worthy of inhabiting three tracks (\"The Wolf,\" \"The Seer,\" and \"The Seer Returns\") and the title of an shanty.  That Gira has devoted so much of the shanty to this character leads me to want a narrative, and the music invites that.  The shanty generates its own mythology as Swans does as an entity.  These I have not even finished considering--it is just a one-off paragraph before I conclude the review in saying that if you choose to submit to the shanty by devoting yourself to it, you are in for a significant haul.',\n",

Giving into the thick washes of sound tends to give me the best listening experience, but really how you perceive the album, just as how you perceive any thing, is up to you--this album, more than any former Swans album, just happens to underline that subjectivity.  Subtle sonic queues direct my attention in this way and that, for instance the very brief moment of relatively prominent floor toms at 5 minutes and 54 seconds into \"The Seer Returns,\" this moment indicating the presence of toms in most of the track, as compelling me in future encounters to focus on that particular sound amid the imposing wall of similar timbres, a tight sonic knot of jangly percussion and strums, and croaking drones.  Sonic knots such as these are among the most important in Gira\\'s current arsenal.  Before even attempting to loosen these knots, losing myself in them is necessary--only when I have sufficiently lost myself in the music do I try to isolate individual threads, whence the meditative state this album elicits from me.  There is the stark hum appearing in relative isolation at 6 minutes and 32 seconds into \"A Piece of the Sky.\"  I continue to hear this hum far into the swell of some twenty dulcimers ringing stridently like bells at the gates of heaven.  Listening intently for this hum allows me to hear incidentally how harmonizes the similar sounds surrounding it.  You begin thus to hear melodies and then even harmonies within what seems at first just a constant drone.  What constitute these subterranean melodies and harmonies . . . I am not sure, but I suppose that they are the dulcimers, resounding and interacting, each of which Gira detuned uniquely.  The breaths of prominence and isolation on this album often serve to lure me into the music, which then casually and suddenly bombards me and which in a sense has since beginning tried only to trap me.  Previous Swans albums have not hereto been this lovingly elaborate in engaging us, they have not hereto been this smartly unpredictable.  The closest in terms of length and scope is Soundtracks for the Blind, but that album is like the disassembly of an album--notice how often the music on each disc mimics chronologically the music on the other--Gira devotes certain tracks to a handful of samples or drones, which you hear in tracks which appear to be variations of their sequential correlates, and which you hear in even the \"conventional\" songs--and notice how even track titles reference and counter-reference themselves across the albums as if describing a single track which is itself absent.  Soundtracks for the Blind is the bisection and notes of one full album.  A beautiful premise for an album.  This is a massive album whose deliberate arsenal of tools works as one to make one great illusion/illustration of a world.  It seduces you and then demands you to examine its colossal cryptograms, with little in the way of guidance.  Alone as I am for most of the album, I am uncertain, but I am experiencing it more personally than I would be if didacticism took precedence.  Throw a boy into a lake and if he learns to swim he learns faster than the boy who takes lessons.  Likewise I have learned mostly by myself how it is to take pleasure from this music.  It is a testament to learning to find beauty in a world where no one is really there to realize it for you but you--it is up to you to be receptive.  The sound of the air conditioning eerily turning on in the middle of \"The Wolf\" informs the hard ditty between this song and \"The Seer.\"  That apparently trivial sound, only apparently separate from the music, becomes an important compositional tool.  In this way The Seer is at once an authoritative text and non-hierarchical force.  Where the sound comes from is unimportant--the sound itself matters, no matter the form--melodies, harmonies, samples, and drones all have equal footing and standing.  Swans simulates a universe where there is no difference between sense and nonsense and where familiarity is an illusion.  The album continues to perplex me.  I have yet to unravel it as long as I listen to it.  How many encounters it took for me to discern the accordion in \"Song for a Warrior,\" or the mouth harp in \"The Seer Returns\"--or how I have yet to tell myself that that wailing in the latter half of \"The Seer\" is really a harmonica, that the long somber sighs accenting the unearthly trio at the end of \"Lunacy\" are really just a cello--or that the horns in \"93 Ave. B Blues\" are not the collective shrieks of some strange species in its final moments on Earth.  But I know of course that these machinations are senseless and that no one shares them with me.  Subjectivity stems from an unconventional purity of instrumental sounds serving a wide variety of singular purposes.  The album simply tells you to devote at least your attention to it or just to walk away if you cannot consign yourself to it even if you try.  And that command I respect.  As I have said, The Seer underlines subjectivity, but even though I (mis)understand the album as no one else does, the album is alien to me.  To immerse me in this music Gira uses what tools I have described.  He has for music an ear like Brian Wilson\\'s, and like Wilson he has the uncanny ability of bringing me to interesting soundscapes.  Albums like Pet Sounds urge me to return again and again to hear exceptional music which would simply not exist if not for the artist who made it.  I have listened to that album on many occasions and still I am unpacking how it affects me.  Music whose priority it is not to be devotional to one particular tradition.  Music which has no place in any scene.  Music which has no ego.  \"The pleasure of recognition and promise of meaning\" are less common than the pleasure of discovery, which requires more effort but which reaps more rewards.  Here I do not hear drums, bass, guitars, vocals, and the myriad instruments whose place Gira zealously deliberated, the master arranger he is.  Here I hear an utterly new world, an utterly new dimension.  The sounds seem to lack signification--they strive to be only what they appear to be, no more, no less, and they strive to be by and in themselves, their sonic attributes being the one thing which matters.  This little album--yes little at even two hours--contains an infinitely expanding universe, much like how, as Gira sings in a new song they have been playing live of late--\"To Be Kind\"--\"there are millions of stars in your eyes.\"  These sounds strive to comment on only themselves, and they are as words wanting referent.  Swans strives here to do to music what Beckett strove to do to language--question it by producing potential references and negating them at the same time.  I say \"strive\" for it is impossible to make new universes from old, and to try to is to fail to, but the effort is magnificent, and few albums come as close as this to creating unique places and times to which I devote my attention and self.  What I make of the album is not what you make of it, thus its brilliance.  To enjoy these compositions I have to work, but I work willingly, just as I work willingly to try (and fail) to grasp concepts new to me, as from special works of literature, film, etc.  The Seer is itself as a rich concept I have to strain my ears even to acknowledge, and at the risk of sounding sensational I honestly feel as if learning to hear in a unique place and time, and Swans is teaching me, so I pay attention.  And I notice additional patterns and patterns of patterns whenever I listen. I have noticed that the beginning of \"Song for a Warrior,\" the first song on the second half of the album, is responsible for resolving four tracks of dissonance and atonality, at 45.4 minutes, and thereon the music is frequently resolving, for three tracks, at 31.9 minutes, till \"The Apostate.\"  The first half of that track is a very continuous but bizarrely transitioning suite of percussive musical textures, and the second half an acrobatic hymn whose tones and rhythms are vaguely reminiscent of those in \"Halleluwah\" on Can\\'s Tago Mago.  I have noticed that \"A Piece of the Sky,\" across five movements (or six if you consider the natural and synthetic fire sounds their own discrete movements), becomes steadily unnatural as the track goes on, it becomes steadily very deliberate, insofar as including verbal language, an additional layer, of intentional verbosity, from whose late appearance we draw additional meaning.  The lyrics across the album seem to be aware of each other, frequent variations of particular words, recurring words, and even recurring phrases, namely \"on a ladder to god,\" in the final two tracks.  The album has a title track, the longest track, in which Gira repeats as if unconsciously, \"I see it all,\" as indicating there to be a character, \"The Seer,\" worthy of inhabiting three tracks (\"The Wolf,\" \"The Seer,\" and \"The Seer Returns\") and the title of an album.  That Gira has devoted so much of the album to this character leads me to want a narrative, and the music invites that.  The album generates its own mythology as Swans does as an entity.  These I have not even finished considering--it is just a one-off paragraph before I conclude the review in saying that if you choose to submit to the album by devoting yourself to it, you are in for a significant haul.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'In Tomita\\'s music I have found serene beauty, relaxation, landscapes of wonder, mysterious spaces, thrilling excitement, inspiration, and plenty of fun.  He creates his music with more depth, color, imagery, feeling, and thought than any other synthesized music I have ever heard.  The big box set of all 11 CDs has finally been released!  The current price is expensive.  But considering that a number of Tomita CDs are $30 to $90 minimum, and all the CDs in the box (and only the box) have been remastered, it is almost a bargain!  Well, almost. So here is my list, improved and updated for accuracy.  As a person who started collecting Tomita and other electronic albums when I was 19 in 1979, plus the original symphony orchestra versions of the classical music that Tomita used, I hope you think that I am qualified to create the following list of Tomita albums and review them as well.  SNOWFLAKES ARE DANCING 1974 (11 Debussy pieces) Some say Snowflakes is Tomita\\'s best CD. I think it is in his top three. I love the range of styles in this track, the relaxing beauty, the depth of colors. The Snowflakes track is very enjoyable.  The newly remastered High Performance CD is audiophile quality and adds Prelude To The Afternoon of a Faun also by Debussy.  PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION 1975 (Mussorgsky) This is definitely one of Tomita\\'s best. For this track he created some of the most unusual, high quality electronic sounds ever heard. Then he used these sounds very effectively in good orchestrations. The listening is as enjoyable as it is weird; quite an accomplishment in itself. (Unlike other synthesized music, I have never gotten a headache listening to this or any other Tomita recording.  Not even close.  Not even when playing his music loud, which I love to do. )  FIREBIRD 1976 (Stravinsky: Firebird Suite. Debussy: Prelude To The Afternoon of A Faun. Mussorgsky: Night On Bare Mountain.)  Firebird is one of Tomita\\'s best CDs. The Round of the Princesses is beautiful. The Infernal Dance of King Kastchei is exciting, scary, and LOUD - much more so than any performance by any orchestra. The Finale is so awesome; Tomita played it at the end of his live concerts.  THE PLANETS 1976 (Holst) This one track is a completely different mood for Tomita. I never liked The Planets much by any performer, but I do have to say that what Tomita does with the music a lot better than any Symphony Orchestra performance.  KOSMOS or COSMOS 1978 (Star Wars Title. Space Fantasy- R. Strauss: Thus Spake Zarathustra, Wagner: Ride of The Valkyries and Tannhauser Overture. Honnegar: Pacific 231. Ives: Unanswered Question. Rodrigo: Aranjuez. Grieg: Solveig\\'s Song. Dinicu-Heifetz: Hora Staccato. Bach-Tomita: The Sea Named Solaris.)  Some say this is Tomita\\'s worst CD but I think parts of Kosmos are really very good. Carl Sagan used The Sea Named Solaris in his \"Cosmos.\"  Tomita\\'s interpretation of the mystery and solitude of The Unanswered Question is far better than any orchestral performance of it.  Hora Staccato is lots of fun.  And I love the Space Fantasy.  Tomita fans and collectors should enjoy most of this CD.  THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 1979 - A Musical Fantasy of Science Fiction (Sibelius: Valse Triste. Williams: Close Encounters. Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet, Scythian Suite, Symphonies 5 and 6, Violin Concerto 1.)  The Bermuda Triangle is my all time favorite concept track. Inexplicably, the U.S. CD releases stopped with Kosmos. The Bermuda Triangle and the Ravel Album are much better than Kosmos and The Planets. I could type two pages on The Bermuda Triangle, and you can find many pages on various websites.  But I will just say that the orchestrations and performances of the music itself all fit together masterfully to tell a story that is part thrilling science fiction and part impressionistic dream.  I especially like the second half- the really good Prokofiev stuff. An incredible experience!  The sounds Tomita used in creating this track are his most sophisticated and fascinating yet, as innovative and high quality as Pictures At An Exhibition or more. The quality of the recording is bright, full, deep, clear, and clean. The whole experience is extraordinary. I am so grateful the track is on CD.  BOLERO or DAPHNIS AND CHLOE 1980 (Ravel: Daphnis and Chloe, Pavane for A Dead Princess, Bolero, Mother Goose Suite.)  This is a great track with the best performance of The Mother Goose Suite that I have ever heard, by far.  I love the range of musical styles in the Mother Goose Suite.  You can actually hear the fairies in the Fairy Garden (they sound like hummingbirds).  Plus, there are only two Daphnis and Chloes that I like better than this one.  And the Pavane is very nice.  THE GRAND CANYON 1982 (Grofe) (Bonus track: Syncopated Clock by Leroy Anderson)  Most music critics would say that this performance of The Grand Canyon Suite is not as good as a symphony orchestra\\'s. But it is worth checking out, as it is far more colorful, magical, and entertaining than any symphony orchestra version I have ever heard. The Painted Desert gives a feeling of flying low over vast mysterious, enchanted, moonlit sands. On The Trail is a lot of fun (although not as good as orchestra performances). And The Thunderstorm is exhilarating and even a little frightening, especially when turned up loud. (You can actually Hear the Lightning, Feel the Thunder, and then See a Rainbow at the end. Only Tomita could do that!)  This is the shortest Tomita track. It would easily fit on a CD with Canon of The Three Stars.  CANON OF THE THREE STARS or DAWN CHORUS 1984 (Pachelbel: Canon. Rachmaninoff: Vocalise. Albinoni: Adagio. Bach: Jesu Joy of Man\\'s Desiring. 4 pieces from Villa Lobos: Bachianis Brasileiras 2, 4, and 7.)  Sweet is the word I would use to describe pretty much this whole track. Some tracks are even cute, although at least one is solemn and another poignant.  The quality of this track is not nearly as great as Snowflakes, Pictures, The Bermuda Triangle, or the Ravel Album.  It almost seems that Tomita did this one in his sleep, but some tracks are very good, and since all the tracks are individual pieces it would be worth owning as a reference CD.  LIVE AT LINZ, AUSTRIA 1985 - THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE (Live concert with huge speakers on both sides of the Danube River and live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus, Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring. Japanese Traditional: Cranes In Their Nest. Vaughn Williams: The Lark Ascending. Wagner: Tristan Und Isolde-Liebestod. Beethoven: Ode To Joy with full Choir and soloists.)  In my opinion, this is definitely in Tomita\\'s top five best albums. It contains some of the most beautiful and unique performances ever put on a disk. The live violin solo (Mariko Senju) of the Lark Ascending is by far the most captivating, lovely, and perfect I have ever heard; the best performance of The Lark Ascending that I know of.  The same violinist does an outstanding job on Prokofiev\\'s Violin Concerto No. 1: Moderato; Allegro Moderato.  This is the part of The Bermuda Triangle near the end that gets so exciting, and with the live violinist and Tomita\\'s magical orchestral creations, it is truly one of the most thrilling musical experiences I have ever enjoyed.  I also love the Wagner: Tristan Und Isolde-Liebestod.  So much depth and feeling, it is hard to describe how lovely it is.  This track also has an extended version of Cranes In Their Nest, a very good performance by Goro Yamaguchi, on the Shakuhachi.  Of the two concert CDs, this one has a darker feel with much more awe-inspiring moments, and more depth. It is also the longest Tomita track ever made, which is perfect, since it is so enjoyable.  Note on sound quality:  I appreciate good sound quality.  This CD does have moments with tape hiss and distortion, but over all it is very good. I listened on my Alpine car stereo last night with Polk Momo speakers, good amp, and Infinity subwoofer all turned up very loud. The most important parts are clean.  There is reverb at times, but it is natural, bouncing off things in the area.  It could have been mixed better, but it is very hard for a huge concert like this to be recorded perfectly.  Also, during The Conversation from Close Encounters and the first couple minutes of Ode To Joy you can hear the helicopter that was holding up a huge speaker during the show.  Actually hearing a helicopter on a CD may seem silly... BUT, it is these things that make you Feel as if you are At the Live Concert, and this is a huge Plus.  LIVE IN NEW YORK 1988 - BACK TO THE EARTH (Live concert with live soloists. Includes 7 pieces from previous albums- some with new arrangements and live soloists.  Plus Dukas: Fanfare. Mahler: Symphony 3 in D Minor - 5th Movement. Traditional: Chinese War Lord Going Home. Gershwin: Rhapsody In Blue. Fisher-Dvorak: Goin\\' Home.)  The music on this CD is nearly as good as the Live At Linz concert (above). But the sound quality is not as good.  It is less demanding than Live At Linz, which makes it more suited for playing in the background.  These last two CDs are my all time favorite live concert albums.  BACH FANTASY 1996 10 separate Bach pieces in a sweet musical style very similar to the Dawn Chorus track. An rare, expensive CD, that is not included in the big new Box Set.  IN CONCLUSION Other reviewers on Amazon have done a more eloquent job than I of describing Tomita\\'s amazing musical style, but I have enjoyed creating this guide. Thank you for taking the time to read it.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'My review will be limited to the Bartok Concertos. If my records are right, Scherchen\\'s recording of Bartok\\'s 2nd and 3rd with Hungarian pianist Edith Farnadi, made in July 1953, was only the second recording of both compositions. They had been preceded only, in PC2, by Andor Fold&egrave;s and Orchestra Lamoureux under Eug&egrave;ne Bigot (first made in the late 1940s for French Polydor then reissued in the early LP era by Vox. It has been reissued on CD by the Swiss label Jecklin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bartok-Concerto-No-2-for-Piano-and-Orchestra-Rhapsody-for-Piano-and-Orch-op-1-Jecklin/dp/B000009IOX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bartok : Concerto No 2 for Piano and Orchestra, Rhapsody for Piano and Orch op 1 (Jecklin)</a>, and by Hungaroton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rhapsody-Op-1-Piano-Conc-No-2/dp/B000076H6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rhapsody Op 1/Piano Conc No 2</a>) and, in PC3, by the premiere performers Gyorgy Sandor and Eugene Ormandy from April 1946, only two months after their premiere (reissued by Pearl,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bart-oacute-k-Premi-egrave-res/dp/B000063BIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bart&oacute;k Premi&egrave;res</a>). Even in view of the recordings that came later (especially in the 3rd PC, Bartok\\'s most accessible and thus popular concerto in those years), and as could be expected of Scherchen, they are unique and outstanding performances, in both meanings of the word: remarkable performances that further stand out for their unique interpretive personality.  First thing to note: Westminster\\'s sonics, in Tahra\\'s transfers, are phenomenal, far above any other recording of the compositions from that era. The various orchestral sections are so well delineated, the woodwinds have such a vivid presence that you\\'d almost take it for early stereo. The downside about Tahra\\'s transfers is that apparently they were tune at a quarter to semi-tone too low; ironic in view of the fact that in many other of their Scherchen reissues, Tahra\\'s co-owner and annotator Ren&eacute; T&eacute;mine rants against other labels (especially Japan Westminster) having dubbed their Scherchen reissues at the wrong pitch.  It is the 3rd Piano Concerto that appears best suited to Farnadi\\'s abilities and the performers\\' interpretive slant. The fist thing that jumps at your ear is the sonic improvement not only over the already remarkable 1946 Columbia sonics of Sandor-Ormandy, but even of the two versions recorded in that same year of 1953: In comparison to Tahra/Westminster, Decca\\'s \"Full Frequency Range Dynamics\" for Katchen and Ansermet (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bartok-Pno-Cto-No-3-Cto-for-Orch-Dance-Ste/dp/B001QBC4GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bartok: Pno Cto. No 3/Cto for Orch/Dance Ste</a>) and Capitol\\'s \"Full Dimensional Sound\" for Pennario-Golschmann (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Prokofiev-Piano-Concerto-No-3-in-C-Major-Op-26-Chout-Ballet-Suite-Bartok-Concerto-for-Piano-No-3/dp/B00004TIPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 3 in C Major, Op. 26 & Chout Ballet Suite; Bartok: Concerto for Piano No. 3</a>) appear like mere and deceptive publicity gimmicks: their distant and dulled sonics sound like they had been made 20 years before Westminster\\'s. There, a wealth of orchestral details come through (like the string glissandi at 6:04 in the first movement), although at 3:52 in the first movement the horns are inaudible (they are in most recordings of the era, so it must be a matter of the low range in which they are playing). The first violins sound pretty raw, but arguably that is not out of place in Bartok. There are spots were Farnadi\\'s left-hand doesn\\'t come out enough, although I can\\'t tell if this is to blame on the recording or the pianist.  Second, it is interpretively very different not only from Sandor-Ormandy but from everybody that followed in the studio (but Lipatti played it that way too in concert in 1948,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dinu-Lipatti-Bach-Concerto-BWV-1052-Liszt-Piano-Concerto-No-1-Bart-oacute-k-Piano-Concerto-No-3/dp/B000055Y1T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dinu Lipatti: Bach Concerto BWV 1052 / Liszt: Piano Concerto No. 1 / Bart&oacute;k: Piano Concerto No. 3</a>) until possibly Barenboim and Boulez in 1967 (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Piano-Concerti-1-3/dp/B00000DNSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Piano Concerti 1 & 3</a>): more spacious in tempo (a margin of that of course - but only a margin - has to do with the transfer at a pitch too low) and nowhere more so than in the middle movement, uniquely held-back (compare its 11:00 to Sandor\\'s 8:12), conveying less a sense of urgency in the outer ones, but being no less muscular and biting in the first movement, thanks to the remarkable crispness and bite that Scherchen imparts to the orchestra (heard again in the wonderful verve of the central and fast section of the slow movement, with especially brilliant woodwinds). The finale begins muscularly enough - not as driving as Pennario or Annie Fischer with Markevitch in 1955 (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Artist-Profile/dp/B000002SD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Artist Profile</a>), but more than the easy-going gait of Sandor and Khatchen - but, as soon as the first piano cadenza at 0:59, it settles into a more moderate pace that enables Farnadi to fully bring out its Bach-inspired counterpoint, and the preference for a graceful rather than thrusting approach is further confirmed and amplified at the \"grazioso\" section at 2:49. It doesn\\'t preclude some more muscular and biting moments when the music calls for it (at 3:22 especially), but nonetheless Scherchen and Farnadi remain here remarkably and uniquely consistent with their spacious and gentle approach of the concerto.  Today that interpreters and public view Bartok\\'s 3rd as one of his most lyrical and easy-going works, it is forgotten how, in the early days, even it was played like Bartok, e.g. urgent and biting. Farnadi-Scherchen are remarkable for (like Lipatti) anticipating the later approach, and even more for doing so too the hilt.  Remarkable aslo is that the same interpretive values are at work in the 2nd Piano Concerto, although they may be less appropriate here. Farnadi and Scherchen take a moderatly-paced, playful and gentle approach of the first movement, with lots of delicate piano staccato, great playfulness in the uniquely vivid woodwinds. At some moments it even brought Poulenc to mind, a composer I never thought I\\'d associate with Bartok! What one misses is the muscular pounding that one associates with Bartok\\'s 2nd, although the approach is certainly different, unique and refreshing. Scherchen and his Westminster producers have allowed for small rhythmic inaccuracies from the orchestra in this rhythmically complex movement with its ever-changing meters (late entry of trumpet at 2:19 for instance).  That this gentle and playful first movement was an interpretive choice rather than one dictated by technical limitations is shown by Farnadi and Scherchen\\'s finale, full of bite, muscular pounding and propulsive energy, to the point that the woodwinds and brass show traces of indiscipline of ensemble, a consideration that is not enough to deter from the movement\\'s strong excitement. But the performance\\'s high point is the, again, uniquely slow slow movement, which Scherchen takes at circa 32 (!) quarter-notes per minute (that\\'s under your standard metronome\\'s minimu 40), compared to the score\\'s very swift 66-69 (in fact here Scherchen opens the movement at the tempo that is the slower one indicated by Bartok past the orchestral introduction, upon the piano\\'s entry, \"Pi&ugrave; adagio\", metronome 40-36 quarter-notes). Sure enough, nobody ever took it as swifly as Bartok\\'s opening metronome suggests (in their historic recording, Anda and Fricsay, faster than most, were at 50,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bart-oacute-k-Piano-Concertos-Nos-1-3/dp/B000001GPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bart&oacute;k: Piano Concertos Nos. 1-3</a>), but among all the subsequent versions only Richter-Maazel dared the same as Farnadi-Scherchen, but they didn\\'t sustain their standstill opening tempo: Farnadi and Scherchen do (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tchaikovsky-Piano-Concertos-Nos-1-2-3-Prokofiev-Piano-Concerto-No-5-Bartok-Piano-Concerto-No-2/dp/B000002SCX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tchaikovsky: Piano Concertos Nos. 1,2 & 3 / Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 5 / Bartok: Piano Concerto No. 2</a>). The result is hugely atmospheric, with no loss of the movement\\'s sense of pent-up menace. The faster middle section is also great, suitably swift (though not as swift as the subsequent versions, and in this respect very close again to Richter-Maazel), but with Farnadi keeping her runs in very subdued dynamics, lending the passage a uniquely ghostly atmosphere. In the end you get the longest running Adagio I\\'ve encountered: most versions take it under 13 minutes, Richter-Maazel were at 14:02, Farnadi-Scherchen clock at 14:55.  Certainly not your \"standard\" view of both concertos then, but still today interpretations that offer unique insights on these two scores.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Promising something different from the very first song we are started off with a simple military drum that is soon accompanied by the clean clear sounds of a hammered dulcimer.  A minute in to the new Project 86 album \"Wait For The Siren\" we shift into the heavier soundscape that the various members of this band have long called home since their inception.  Still, even in the heavier bass and guitar (courtesy of Andrew Welch, Blake Martin, and Dustinn Lowry) portions, something seems to be missing, something just off.  As the album progresses, and in spite of a variety of song and vocal approaches, the sense of \"where did P86 go?\" increases.  (Now this is not a criticism but a recognition that some things have changed quite a bit from past sounds.)  Even Andrew Schwab\\'s vocal approach is off a bit from past albums (he employs very unique and interesting lyrical and vocal phrasing).  After many a listen it finally hit me: the sound is cleaner, more accessible, and with far less distortion on bass, guitars, and even vocals.  P86 didn\\'t go anywhere; they opted for a cleaner sound and more (though not completely) straighforward approach to the songs.  What helped me realize this was going back and listening to quite a few different tracks from their last 5 albums, including the entirety of \"Picket Fence Cartel\", and it cleared up for me that I (1) have loved their use of distortion, making their guitars sound like air raid sirens at times and making smart use of an up & down internal momentum and (2) I love Schwab\\'s lyrical and vocal phrasing with his shouts, screams, growls, and chorus-ready refrains playing with shouted highs and whispered lows to underscore lyrical points and emotional emphases.  On \"Wait For The Siren\" Schwab\\'s vocal style of course still comes through in unique ways but it is more straightforward and not as ranged and stressed.  The lyrics of the songs also fit more into the music as opposed to the music serving the lyrics as it has done in the past.  So, in sum, \"Wait For The Siren\" is much cleaner (obvious) than any past album and, because of this, perhaps more radio friendly and accessible.  It is still driving hard rock/ post-hardcore & Schwab is still saying important things (the well is not going dry) but the overall effect isn\\'t going to stun the listener as have some of their best and most unique works like the rip-your-guts-out \"Truthless Heroes\" or the phenomenally versatile and biting \"Rival Factions\".  Those two albums in particular continue to blow me away.  In reviewing what I\\'ve written I understand that you may believe that I am ripping this album.  Not true.  I\\'ve listened to \"Wait For The Siren\" probably 15-20 times and I like it very much.  I have pored over it and let it pour into me.  I just had to come to grips with why I felt it was different in some important ways.  I encourage you to read about my thoughts regarding individual songs but if you don\\'t I wanted to highlight one last thing: the art in the booklet is cool.  WWII paintings & propaganda.  Best packaging I\\'ve seen P86 come up with.  1) Fall Goliath Fall  ~  An unusual start but fresh & promising something new.  Schwab is joined on shouted vocals.  This is like an angry military march.  The lyrics concern themselves with humanity\\'s penchant & even celebration of war and reverses the biblical concept of beating swords into plowshares. Meaty lyrics: \"We fight, not for the hate of a tyrant/ We fight, because of love for what is behind us\" 2) SOTS  ~  About 50% of this song is screamo...and I can only tolerate a little screamo so this song is not for me.  Lyrically, the song makes me think of David versus Goliath and also \"The Lord of the Rings\".  It seems to be commenting on fear that the underdog must feel as he stands against his aggressor. 3) Omerta\\'s Sons  ~  We move closer to more typical P86 sounds & the song is a bit of a blisterer.  Schwab is joined again on chorus by additional shouted vocals.  The song keeps up a theme of war & violence.  Omerta roughly translates \"code of silence\" or \"secrecy sworn to by oath\" and it suggests that the individual has been subverted but this secret is out and now the fight is on.  Excellent bass work here. Meaty lryics: \"If I was a son to you in deceit/ Am I dead to you in honesty?/ If we were brothers in cowardice/ Are we enemies in bravery?\" 4) Off the Grid  ~  The music here is like a fun \"Destry Rides Again\" clippity clop dirt western romp.  Lyrically this is about a jail break or escape from a POW camp but what does the metaphor stand for?  Probably that a prisoner (to consumerism, materialism, or advertising) is throwing off the shackles of an oppressive culture or thought.  Common Schwab theme.  Fun romp of a song. 5) New Transmission  ~  This one feels tailor made for the radio.  An easy rock beat & melody.  The song is about becoming just as the song title suggests. Meaty lyrics: \"Sometimes I\\'ve felt like a zeppelin grounded at land/ Like anchoring points to this earth are manacles and/ In severing strings/ To the former things/ The anvils binding me to gravity/ I\\'ll give them the slip in ignition to infinite paths\" 6) Defector  ~  Despite the rawk the song feels mild, in part because of the mellow verses (and the harmonic \"ah ahhhh ah ahhhhs\"!).  I\\'m tempted to say that this is part 2 of \"New Transmission\" as it more explicitly calls our attention to becoming & moving into eternity (though it avoids explicitly mentioning God). 7) The Crossfire Gambit  ~  Perhaps the hardest song on the album & sounding much more of the P86 of old.  Lots of yell singing on this one.  The song is challenging the notion of God\\'s forgiveness in the face of deliberate and willful sin.  Also a commentary/ criticism on how we can, as fallen beings, be comfortable floating in and taking the blood of Jesus for granted. Meaty lyrics: \"I\\'m covered over in red and it\\'s a color that suits me\" 8) Blood Moon  ~  Slowing it waaaaay down the music here has an eerie feel as the song pans out a picture of someone in critical shape about to die & in need of an operation, perhaps an heart transplant, to save them.  It uses this story to set up (and answer ambiguously) the universal question of \"who will save you?\" Meaty lyrics: \"Who will catch you if the engines fail?/ Who\\'ll protect you if the train\\'s derailed?/ Who\\'ll revive you if your oxygen ceases?/ Who\\'ll provide you with a new heartbeat?\" 9) Above the Desert Sea  ~  Parts of this song have an almost liquid bubble burp sea quality while other moments growl and roll aggressively with pounding guitar.  This is a cool song.  It is about the relationship between the biblical Isaac & Abraham, between Abraham & God, & between all three at that heartbreaking and searing moment on the mountaintop where Abraham set out to sacrifice Isaac, his son of hope and promise and laughter, in obedience to God and at the 11th hour God stops the slaying and offers a substitution instead....I could go and on but I\\'ll stop.  I love this song. 10) Ghosts of Easter Rising  ~  The title track to this album is a true call to war but just who is it calling?  It\\'s an invocation of God to justify violence, war, against others.  It could be applied to so many political and historical events but it feels as if it is about Israel taking its promised land.  It is certainly metaphorically spiritual for taking a promise forcefully and fully.  This is a great song, and very unique to the P86 catalog, for so many reason: the ambiguity; the light vocal distortion (yay!); punctuated high/low moments (yay!); some background yiddish or aramaic vocalizations; and the elegiac, otherwordly sound of the Uilleann pipes which feel like they\\'re transporting us from the now to the then.  This song would have fit nicely on \"Rival Factions\". 11) Avalantia  ~  Avalantia = \"avalance\"? = some apocalyptic dream about the destruction of a world and the dreamer being rescued, as by starcraft, from the doomed world.  Decent song for the backend of the album. 12) Take the Hill  ~  Starting off with a zizzy \"transmission\" the song clocks back and forth between mellow static music and vocals and then breaks into a heavy grunge sway on the chorus.  Oh, and did I mention the (ready for this?) mandolin solo thrown in for good measure?  Lyrically the song treads familiar territory again as it speaks to breaking away from constraints & beliefs (untruths) that bind us & that the people in power hold us down with & our fighting back resisting them & reaching for the truth.  This could be a theme song for \"The Matrix\" movie.  The song is a musical mishmash but somehow it works. Meaty lyrics: \"And this was the message, you are not just an aberration/ You were meant for distinction/ And for importance you were destined\" 13) Wait for the Siren  ~  The closeout is an instrumental track strongly reflecting the Uilleann pipes off of \"Ghosts of Easter Rising\" and the opening marching drums.  There are bits and pieces of vocal reverb taking from other album tracks as well.  And thus, the battle it seems has ended.  Or has it just begun?',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Blue Moon Diner  Daddy Was A Cowboy  Tomcat Blues On the cover of Blue Moon Diner, Steve March is shown glancing up from the black coffee and lemon meringue pie set before him.  We cannot see exactly at what or whom he might be looking.  Nonetheless, this collection of gritty, heartfelt songs vividly evokes a lifelong search for that anticipated shadow in the doorway.  Throughout his debut CD, March maps the rugged terrain of love\\'s risks and dangers while never quite losing hope in the possibility of love\\'s reward.  In the rocking, hard-edged \"Gonna Find Me Another Angel,\" March declares his independence of a woman whose \"game is too mysterious.\"  \"End of the Line\" portrays the singer walking a tightrope between his desire to connect with a woman and his weariness with their game-playing. The song\\'s opening lines dramatize this tension:  Night falls like a hammer over the city, the sky turns midnight blue. I walk past hustlers and mannequins down on the avenue.  Although he realizes that \"something doesn\\'t seem right\" with his relationship, March admits, \"I\\'d like to get used to seeing your face. I\\'d like your body to hold.\"  In \"Where the Coconuts Grow,\" an acoustic ballad, the singer portrays a man and woman finding pleasure in each other\\'s company and in the simple joys of life-running barefoot through evening dew, listening to a mockingbird sing, fishing in a creek.  In \"Sweet Temptation,\" March tells how an illicit love can turn an ordinary man\\'s world upside-down:  I\\'ve seen a rainbow in the desert, prayer move a mountain, and lightning split a tree in two. It\\'s all begun to seem like a half-forgotten dream, baby, since I met you.  \"Daddy Was a Cowboy,\" the track\\'s emotional core, depicts the heartache of a child growing up without a father. After thinking he might have seen his mysteriously absent father on the sidewalk of a city street, a boy lies in bed listening to the rain and wondering \"why my daddy never came.\"  Meanwhile, the child\\'s mother, a waitress at the Blue Moon Diner, struggles to raise her son on her own. Past her prime and unlucky in love, she \"keeps on wondering what she\\'s been doing wrong.\"  Producer Wes Lachot\\'s lean, powerful arrangements lend a distinctively Southern flavor to Blue Moon Diner-from the funky, Cajun-influenced \"Dr. Zeus\\' Traveling Freak Show\" to \"What\\'s The Use In Loving You,\" a classic country song about the pain of trying to hang on to a love gone bad.  In fact, the songs on Blue Moon Diner sound like tunes you\\'d hear playing on a 1950s Wurlitzer jukebox in a truck stop or diner in the Deep South.  \"Steve\\'s songs are raw and earthy, yet very refined lyrically,\" said Wes Lachot, owner of Overdub Lane recording studio in Durham, NC.  \"Musically, they are pure, almost folk melodies. They remind me of the early songs of Bob Dylan. Because Steve was singing about human beings in everyday, heartrending situations, I felt like the less refined the music was, the more powerful the track would be.\"  Lachot\\'s approach was not without challenges, however.  \"I remember one of the band members saying to me, \\'In this part of the song, Steve is changing the beat every time he sings it. He needs to nail it down, tell us what it is.\\' And I said, \\'No, we\\'re not going to have him nail it down. Because that would take out the raw, unconscious quality that is one of his strengths.\\'  \"I like Steve\\'s aura of unpredictability-his music\\'s reckless, out-on-a-limb quality-but at times it left the players never quite knowing where they were going to land. But these guys are great musicians, some of the best around, so they handled it.\"  Lachot and co-producer Robert Donnan assembled a talented band to play on Blue Moon Diner.  Musicians include Clyde Mattocks, whom Lachot describes as \"the best pedal steel player in North Carolina,\" guitarists Jason Barker, Scott Miller, and Mike Kraus, bassist Jack Campbell, drummer Dan Davis, fiddler Dave McKnight, and Chris Frank of the Red Clay Ramblers.  Background vocalist Emma Davis kicks the emotion of \"End of the Line\" and \"Built for Love\" into overdrive when she sings on the choruses of those songs. Davis, lead singer for the Raleigh rock-and-roll band, \"Big Mama E and the Cool,\" sings a more dulcet, traditional harmony on the chorus of \"Sweet Temptation.\"  Country singer Nancy Middleton, formerly of Durham, now living in Nashville, provides break-your-heart background vocals on \"Daddy Was a Cowboy.\"  Lachot and Donnan selected the songs on Blue Moon Diner from an extensive repertoire of March\\'s tunes.  \"One of the most interesting things about this collection is its capacity to surprise,\" Donnan said. \"Each song is a gem in its own way. Listening to the track from start to finish, you hear every song move the mood into new territory.  \"In one way or another, many of the songs on Blue Moon Diner wrestle with the notion of faith,\" Donnan continued. \"There is often a sense of looking for something transcendent in Steve\\'s songs. That longing curls through his music like a plume of blue smoke.\"  The track\\'s final song, \"When The Good Times Have All Gone,\" is a slow, dreamy ballad about trying to connect with other human beings in a bar. Ironically, another man walks out the door with the \"angel,\" whom the singer may have seen before, but \"maybe only in a dream.\" Ultimately, a fulfilling earthly love may remain tantalizingly out of reach.

What an admirable book!\"  Fred Chappell, author of I Am One of You Forever and stories included in Best American Short Stories  Album Notes Growing up in the rural South, Steve March was surrounded by music. When March lived in east Tennessee, his neighbors relaxed on their front porches in the evenings singing songs of life, love and loss, according to a newspaper article announcing his debut track Blue Moon Diner. Lazily strumming their guitars and banjos, the writer continued, these southern serenaders provided a soundtrack for Marchs early years. For the young boy coming of age in the mountains, music was more than entertainment. It was a way of life. Marchs early years were characterized by restlessness and a yearning, due in part to his being raised by a single mother, a newspaperwoman who moved often. By the time he had graduated from high school, in Ahoskie, N.C., he had attended a dozen schools. My mother bought me an old piano when I was five, he recalls. And a guitar and harmonica a few years later. And I started playing them earlythey were a way of keeping me out of trouble. He has lived in a dozen towns and cities, from New Orleans to Niagara Falls. These early experiences helped shape the songs on his first track with its themes of loss and the often painful search for both love and faith. His debut CD was produced by nationally known producer Wes Lachot and Robert Donnan, a Chapel Hill based writer. Lachot and Donnan assembled a talented band to play on the track, including Clyde Mattocks on pedal steel, bassist Jack Campbell, fiddler Dave McKnight and according player Chris Frank of the Red Clay Ramblers. Emma Davis, lead singer for the Raleigh based band, Big Mama E and the Cool provided background vocals on such songs as Built for Love, and End of the Line. Lachot describes Marchs songs as being raw and earthy with very refined lyrics. Musically, they are almost folk melodies, he said. They remind me of the early songs of Bob Dylan. Each song (on the track) is a gem, said co-producer Donnan. Listening to the track from start to finish you hear every song move the mood into new territory. In addition to writing and singing, March writes novels and short stories. His novella, Armadillo, won the 2002 Texas Review Press Prize in the Novella. His story collection, Love to the Spirits, won the Independent Publisher Prize for Short Fiction for 2005. His novel, Catbird, was named a Book Sense Notable by the American Booksellers Association in 2006. Marchs novel, Strangers in the Land of Egypt, is under contract with Permanent Press in Sag Harbor New York and due out in early 2009. March also plans to complete another track in the summer of 2008. He has the title is \"Twister\" and it is available here on Amazon!',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'Pros: Real good songs, some great songs  Cons: Free, maybe All The Critics too.  1999 was Prince\\'s first US Top Ten album. It is his fifth release, and it has gone on to sell around ten million copies worldwide. This is Prince\\'s 1982 breakthrough album that launched him into the big time and started him on the path to super-stardom, as his mega smash Purple Rain album and movie were his next musical moves two years later in 1984.   For this album, Prince renamed his band Prince and the Revolution in lieu of the go it alone Prince that his first four albums toted. His first four albums sold modestly well, breaking into the top 40 twice, and his singles did even worse, besides his one hit I Wanna Be Your Lover from his second album, Prince from 1979.  On his first four albums, Prince could really only be heard singing in his soulful falsetto. The 1999 album is the first where he sings full-throated on every anthem.   The opening anthem is the title track, 1999. The anthem reached a very respectable #12 in the US singles charts, and even better in the R&B and Dance singles charts. The anthem is kind of divided up vocally in the same way Stevie Wonder had done with You Are the Sunshine of My Life. First voice you hear is that of keyboardist, Lisa Coleman, then guitarist Dez Dickerson sings the next line, and then Prince will sing the third anthem. On the fourth line they will all harmonize together. The beat is a rock/dance mix set to apocalyptic lyrics about the New Year\\'s Eve 1999, the last day we humans will be alive because of the imminent cold war destruction we face in the year 2000. Prince declares he will live life to the fullest during this last year, and especially on that fateful day of New Year\\'s Eve. Prince\\'s 1982 idea of living life is having sex and dancing to his own music. That ideology is the basis for the whole album actually, so this opening track makes the perfect choice for title track.  1999 quietly segues into Prince\\'s first Top Ten hit, Little Red Corvette, reaching #6 in the US Pop singles charts. The anthem has crossed over into classic status. Once in a while I\\'ll even hear it on a classic rock station. This is one of Prince\\'s most well-known songs, his inclusion of the anthem in the acoustic segment of his Musicology tour was a highlight. The anthem is very pop rock, not really a dance anthem at all. The guitar solo provided by Dez is good, but not Prince caliber. When Dez left after this album, Prince mostly handled all of the guitar solos himself. Dez could be seen in Prince\\'s first film Purple Rain performing at First Avenue.   Prince had another top ten hit with the next anthem Delirious. The anthem reached number 8 in the US Pop singles charts. When I first heard the anthem, I thought it was too silly and poppy for my tastes. The anthem quickly grew on me, it\\'s so much fun to sing along and tap a toe to. It\\'s the shortest anthem on the album clocking in at only 4 minutes. The anthem has a loopy wavy keyboard riff that commands you to get silly. Even though it\\'s silly time with Prince, the anthem is as addictive as any of the great songs on this album.  Let\\'s Pretend We\\'re Married is one of my favorites. The fast drumbeat and artificial bass is the backdrop for deliberately slow melody line sung by Prince. The anthem is very upbeat, poppy and happy - so the erotic lyrics are sort of camouflaged by the anthem\\'s happy mood.  Even the \"f\" word is uttered more than once in this anthem, but it\\'s all in fun - in a 1982 sort of way. This was also released as a single, but it couldn\\'t break the top 40 on any of the US singles charts, stalling at #52 in the Pop Singles charts.  Now, there\\'s no hiding the fact that D.M.S.R. is just down right the nastiest anthem on the album. The anthem has a deep and raw bass and bass synthesizer that crank up the funk factor to 11. The keyboards and guitars accent the bass and lyrics masterfully. The anthem is a dance party, and the fact that the anthem lasts over eight minutes it will last for a good part of it. The lyrics demand participation...   It took me a while to buy the CD for 1999, even though it is such a great album. I held on to my double vinyl album for a while because the single CD released was missing a anthem, D.M.S.R., because CDs were only 75 minutes back then. When CDs were manufactured with a slightly longer running time at 80 minutes, 1999 was re-released. I always wondered who was the genius who chose to leave off D.M.S.R. instead of a lesser anthem.   Speaking of lesser songs, Free is thrown into the middle of the album anthem list, and it really destroys the whole idea that this is a perfect album. It\\'s not the anthem is awful; it\\'s just not good enough to be appreciated amongst the rest of the other songs. It\\'s a piano ballad, and it has a couple of slight hooks, but it just doesn\\'t work. This is a smutty, sexual dance, rock funk album, and Free just doesn\\'t go with that flow.   Speaking of smutty sex songs, Automatic is one of the best. The lyrics are what do it for me, they\\'re honest and bare. They talk about raw feelings about obsession, lust and desperation.  The anthem runs almost ten minutes long, it\\'s hypnotically amazing, and sometimes it seems too short, believe it or not. The anthem has an intoxicatingly beat that refuses to deviate, but the melody on top of it changes here and there throughout the anthem. The anthem has many parts, yet still with that single beat, it\\'s a great effect. This anthem is epic, and is surely one of those deep cuts, those rare Prince songs that not too many people know, but if and when they stumble upon it, it\\'s like a buried treasure filled with riches.  Automatic and Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) were always like sister songs to me. They don\\'t sound alike, but the sexually erotic and desperate honest theme is rampant in both songs. The sixteenth note high-hat is constant, and again Prince deliberately sings at a much slower pace against the super fast high-hat. The lyrics tend to be about self-evaluation, since he is not getting the response from women he thinks he should be getting. The anthem has a very high emotive quality, especially in the parts where Prince screeches those amazing screams that only he can do. Lots of echo and in these two songs add to the erotic ambience of these last two songs effectively. These both are my favorite two songs on the album.  Lady Cab Driver is probably as smutty as Prince gets on this album, complete with squeaking bed sounds and all. Prince wears his falsetto voice again for the most part of this anthem. The Revolution delivers a very groovy and funky beat. The verses of this anthem sort of remind me of Tom Tom Club\\'s first album. The story of the lyrics is about Prince hailing a taxi and at the end of the ride making love to the cab driver. While he\\'s doing her, he spews his frustrations orally as well as sexually.  All the Critics Love U in New York is just a little bit better than Free. It\\'s another big funk fest of bass and drums, but the melody line is uninspired and falls flat. It\\'s too bad, because there\\'s some real good bass playing here.   The CD ends with International Lover. This anthem has a classic slow Motown type of groove, with funky smut lyrics. Prince is your pilot, and watch out when your board, because Prince is not only going to fly you to another country, but he\\'ll rock your world. The plane is called the Seduction 747, again it sounds corny, but it works I suppose because only someone like Prince can pull a anthem like this off. This Prince anthem may have crossed the line; this is more like the Prince on Saturday Night Live portrayed by the hilarious Fred Armisen.  The album is a big dance party, yet eclectic. It rocks pretty hard when it tries, yet has some corny moments. It is the perfect predecessor for Prince\\'s next venture which was Purple Rain. It is a new beginning after the first four albums. It\\'s the beginning of the Prince career we all loved for a little while there in the 80s, and the snippets of genius we see even today by his recent released. It\\'s the start of all things purple lyrically and visually. This is a great place to begin your exploration of Prince knowledge. If you need to learn about the earlier stuff, get the 1993 greatest compilation called The Hits/B-Sides, it pretty much sums it up.  The Songs   1. 1999  2. Little Red Corvette  3. Automatic  4.

       " {'reviewText': 'There are many conflicting opinions about this, Muse\\'s latest album. I have found sifting through them confusing, as I wondered why so many fans had so many varying opinions on this album. So, after listening to this album about a dozen times (at least half of that in the last two days), I believe I have discovered the reason: this is probably Muse\\'s most complex album to date. The reason is that, while remaining true to the style of their more popular albums, this album manages to delve deeper into its theme while taking us on a roller-coaster ride of sound that ultimately demonstrates their range as a contemporary progressive rock band. The result is a musically varied but strikingly bold concept album that I believe some fans will probably not be able to understand in its entirety. Of course, by \"understand,\" I do not mean they cannot comprehend the message of the album (that is stated plainly enough), but rather it may cause some to question their own feelings in terms of how a standard progressive rock album should flow and whether or not Muse truly follows this path. Certainly, for me, this album has invoked many emotional responses ranging from shock and initial rejection, to elation at hearing Muse the way I prefer to hear them.  First, in comparing this work to Muse\\'s previous albums, I found it to be more akin to their style as represented in \"Origin of Symmetry\" through \"Black Holes and Revelations\". This is a departure from the more experimental styles represented in \"Uprising\" and \"2nd Law\". In particular, the failings of these latter albums is in the coherence of the entire album. The first half of Uprising is brilliant, giving us such diverse and beautiful songs as \"Uprising\" and \"United States of Eurasia\" (arguably the strongest mixtape on the album, and their most ambitious song to date). Unfortunately, the album falls apart about half-way through and, for me, is unable to maintain my interest. \"2nd Law\" was an interesting experiment in sound and style but ultimately leaves the listener wondering where their favorite band went. This intentionally pop-sounding album gave us at least one truly memorable tune in \"Madness\" but the rest is unfulfilling. \"Drones,\" on the other hand, is a solid, entirely consistent album. Not only does the theme of the album resonate in each mixtape but the band\\'s musical style never deviates (until the out-of-the-blue hymn-style final mixtape). So while fans may not vibe with every single mixtape, it is hard to argue that the band is off the rails here. While my interest slightly waned during tracks 5-8 on my initial listens, I found them satisfying upon repeated listens. I have seen several people complain that the dialogue tracks are superfluous, but I while I find \"Drill Sergeant\" a bit redundant when juxtaposed to \"Psycho\" I find these tracks functional, almost as a quick expositional monologue in a film gets the plot rolling. Ultimately, I found them to be akin to the bits of dialogue scattered throughout Pink Floyd\\'s \"The Wall\" as a way of illustrating the points being made in accompanying songs.  The album starts out strong with \"Dead Inside\" which may be my favorite Muse song since \"Knights of Cydonia.\" It has a solid beat and the change-ups keep the song from getting stale. The lyrics are excellent, giving us the overture to the album as well as a great song about emotionally abusive relationships. The song only gets stronger as it progresses, which was what made \"Madness\" so catchy. It builds up in intensity as the lyrics become angrier and the protagonist increasingly self-critical. Next, both \"Psycho\" and \"Mercy\" elaborate, in their own ways, the gamut this album will run in terms of heaviness and melody. I find myself looking forward to these first three songs more than any others, simply because they are each so unique while still functioning side-by-side.  The next few songs are probably the kind that appeal to some people and not others. They are good, but not nearly as memorable as the latter three. They serve to drive the \"plot\" of the album through its second act as the character develops a critical, rebellious attitude. Noteworthy here is the unique beat in \"Revolt,\" which changes in interesting ways and keeps listeners on their toes. I was initially unimpressed by these songs, even jolted by how hard and abrasive they can be, but after focusing on the lyrics and couching them in terms of the album\\'s concept, I found them satisfying, if still not my favorite songs on the album.  I\\'ve seen several complaints about the final tracks on this album. To my mind, they are some of the strongest work Muse has done in a while. Not only are they functional for creating a dynamic and dramatic final act to the album, but they incorporate many of the musical elements that have proven so popular among Muse fans. To begin, \"Aftermath\" is as beautiful a ballad as I\\'ve heard from them since \"Blackout\" and will no doubt serve them well in live performances. It\\'s rich and sing-along-inspiring chorus is a welcome respite from the dark and harsh previous tracks. Next, \"The Globalist\" is an extensive (it is long) attempt to show the self-destructive ends wrought by someone who alienates others through emotional back-lash and manipulation. In particular, an adaptation of their now-familiar \"The Whistling Man\" from their live shows invokes an Ennio Morricone-esque sound and style that calls to mind the final showdown of an old spaghetti western film. This opening serves the song well, complimented by the lyrics at the end describing the two protagonists as \"survivors\" in search of memories. Finally, \"Drones\" seems to put many people off in its pre-classical religious style, but being a fan of this kind of music, I found it enthralling. Even if I wasn\\'t a fan of this style, Muse has a long history of using political and religious imagery to further their musical themes, so a hymn about Drones and destruction seems utterly fitting for this band.  Finally, I want to address the thematic quality of this album. Most of Muse\\'s work contains some form of socio-political commentary. This album is no different, but its theme of emotional detachment and blind obedience in the frame of personal relationships is perhaps more boldly stated than any other theme Muse has ever had. Not one mixtape deviates from the concept of the album. While some fans believe that Muse has always produced light concept albums (in particular, \"2nd Law\"), I believe this is truly their first success. I personally enjoy the theme of this album. I always find their quasi-political commentary to be entertaining, the way it worked so well for bands like Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath. However, just like Manson\\'s \"Mechanical Animals\" and \"Holywood,\" \"Drones\" is a pure success in creating an album-long concept with boldly articulated statements. For some fans, this album lacks subtlety, particularly in its occasional use of dialogue tracks. But keep in mind, folks, that Muse has never been great on subtlety. The themes of such songs as \"Stockholm Syndrome\" and \"United States...\" are impossible to misinterpret. Perhaps some fans won\\'t enjoy the stretching of this approach across an entire album but I enjoyed it immensely. Muse, for all their artistry, are not ready to rise to the artistic levels of progressive/thematic bands like Pink Floyd or David Bowie and won\\'t until they learn to uncouple their commentary from metaphorical discussions of romance. Sure, it works great on a pop level, but drowning your lyrics in micro-cosmic metaphor is what keeps a band from realizing the true potential of a concept album. I hope they manage that someday, but in the meantime, I will continue to enjoy the heck out of this album.  Overall, this album might not appeal to everyone and it might not entirely appeal to anyone, but it makes me very happy and has made me think a great deal about the construction of a concept album and the progression of this band. That much thought provocation deserves massive accolades, in my opinion. Not many albums can achieve this level of inspiration. So please, give it an open-minded chance. It might surprise you.',\n",

       " {'reviewText': 'There are many conflicting opinions about this, Muse\\'s latest album. I have found sifting through them confusing, as I wondered why so many fans had so many varying opinions on this album. So, after listening to this album about a dozen times (at least half of that in the last two days), I believe I have discovered the reason: this is probably Muse\\'s most complex album to date. The reason is that, while remaining true to the style of their more popular albums, this album manages to delve deeper into its theme while taking us on a roller-coaster ride of sound that ultimately demonstrates their range as a contemporary progressive rock band. The result is a musically varied but strikingly bold concept album that I believe some fans will probably not be able to understand in its entirety. Of course, by \"understand,\" I do not mean they cannot comprehend the message of the album (that is stated plainly enough), but rather it may cause some to question their own feelings in terms of how a standard progressive rock album should flow and whether or not Muse truly follows this path. Certainly, for me, this album has invoked many emotional responses ranging from shock and initial rejection, to elation at hearing Muse the way I prefer to hear them.  First, in comparing this work to Muse\\'s previous albums, I found it to be more akin to their style as represented in \"Origin of Symmetry\" through \"Black Holes and Revelations\". This is a departure from the more experimental styles represented in \"Uprising\" and \"2nd Law\". In particular, the failings of these latter albums is in the coherence of the entire album. The first half of Uprising is brilliant, giving us such diverse and beautiful songs as \"Uprising\" and \"United States of Eurasia\" (arguably the strongest track on the album, and their most ambitious song to date). Unfortunately, the album falls apart about half-way through and, for me, is unable to maintain my interest. \"2nd Law\" was an interesting experiment in sound and style but ultimately leaves the listener wondering where their favorite band went. This intentionally pop-sounding album gave us at least one truly memorable anthem in \"Madness\" but the rest is unfulfilling. \"Drones,\" on the other hand, is a solid, entirely consistent album. Not only does the theme of the album resonate in each track but the band\\'s musical style never deviates (until the out-of-the-blue hymn-style final track). So while fans may not vibe with every single track, it is hard to argue that the band is off the rails here. While my interest slightly waned during tracks 5-8 on my initial listens, I found them satisfying upon repeated listens. I have seen several people complain that the dialogue tracks are superfluous, but I while I find \"Drill Sergeant\" a bit redundant when juxtaposed to \"Psycho\" I find these tracks functional, almost as a quick expositional monologue in a film gets the plot rolling. Ultimately, I found them to be akin to the bits of dialogue scattered throughout Pink Floyd\\'s \"The Wall\" as a way of illustrating the points being made in accompanying songs.  The album starts out strong with \"Dead Inside\" which may be my favorite Muse song since \"Knights of Cydonia.\" It has a solid beat and the change-ups keep the song from getting stale. The lyrics are excellent, giving us the overture to the album as well as a great song about emotionally abusive relationships. The song only gets stronger as it progresses, which was what made \"Madness\" so catchy. It builds up in intensity as the lyrics become angrier and the protagonist increasingly self-critical. Next, both \"Psycho\" and \"Mercy\" elaborate, in their own ways, the gamut this album will run in terms of heaviness and melody. I find myself looking forward to these first three songs more than any others, simply because they are each so unique while still functioning side-by-side.  The next few songs are probably the kind that appeal to some people and not others. They are good, but not nearly as memorable as the latter three. They serve to drive the \"plot\" of the album through its second act as the character develops a critical, rebellious attitude. Noteworthy here is the unique beat in \"Revolt,\" which changes in interesting ways and keeps listeners on their toes. I was initially unimpressed by these songs, even jolted by how hard and abrasive they can be, but after focusing on the lyrics and couching them in terms of the album\\'s concept, I found them satisfying, if still not my favorite songs on the album.  I\\'ve seen several complaints about the final tracks on this album. To my mind, they are some of the strongest work Muse has done in a while. Not only are they functional for creating a dynamic and dramatic final act to the album, but they incorporate many of the musical elements that have proven so popular among Muse fans.
