# SecondYearProject2021


## Phase 2:
- Vi laver 50-100 sv√¶re beskrivelser hver. 
- Make sure labes are correct
- Make sure samples are motivated and explainable
- checklist code, code yourself, manual generation
- data format should be in the same format as the original training data
- present generated samples april 13-15

### CheckList Process Test Types
- Vocabulary + POS: important words or groups of words (by part-of-speech) for the task
- Taxonomy: synonyms, antonyms, word categories, etc
- Robustness: to typos, irrelevant additions, contractions, etc
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): person names, locations, numbers, etc
- Fairness
- Temporal understanding: understanding order of events and how they impact the task
- Negation
- Coreference
- Semantic Role Labeling (SRL): understanding roles such as agent, object, passive/active, etc
- Logic: symmetry, consistency, conjunctions, disjunctions, etc


## Ideas
- Come up with something that is difficult where the system breaks down.
- Negations, pertubation
