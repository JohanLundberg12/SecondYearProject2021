## Todo

- Basic Exploration of the data
- Extract reviewtext method: takes as input a DataFrame Column, and tokenizes(calls tokenize method) each reviewText. Returns a list of lists of tokens.
- Tokenize method: Takes as input a string(the reviewText for instance) and returns a list of tokens(tokenized according to the method's options).
- Extract sentiment column: takes a DataFrame column and returns a list of strings, each string is the sentiment. 
- Base Line Models: Unigram, Bigram, trigram models, NB or FeedForward Neural Network (FFNN(will need embeddings for this)


## Ideas

- We could include summary as part of the reviewText(combine them into one long string)
