## Phase 2:
- Make sure labes are correct
- Make sure samples are motivated and explainable
- checklist code, code yourself, manual generation
- data format should be in the same format as the original training data
- present generated samples april 13-15


## Ideas
- Come up with something that is difficult where the system breaks down.
- Negations, pertubation
