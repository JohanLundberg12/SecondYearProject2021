1,"Didn't cause any acne on my already blemished skin. The mineral primer and foundation are great. The foundation has a very buildable coverage and the set includes 2 shades. I am an asian and the shade honey fits me well. The setting powder is soso, not worth for a regular size.<br /><br />Honey: neutral undertone<br />Soft Belge: yellow undertone",positive,fairness
2,"I have used this product for over a year with good results but in December I used a kit and whoa, terrible results. I applied relaxer as directed and left it on 12 minutes (I have fine hair but a lot of it) and after using the neutralizing shampoo (amazing for softening and conditioning) and the ORS deep conditioner in the kit (pure garbage)-- the results on my hair were not good. There was a clear line of demarcation between previous relaxed hair (using ORS) and this new touch-up that did not come out straight, or even wave. This NL relaxer just made my hair extremely rough looking, dull and lifeless. Seems like a change in formula, ORS, not a smart move-- at all.  It has taken me 2 months of weekly rounds of deep conditioning with Nexxus Emergencee, Rolland Rebuild therapy (great for moisturizing) still the demarcation was still very visible. I finally I tried another deep protein conditioner Mega Tek-- $29 on Amazon, and with NExxus Headdress (leave in), Argan product and a hot flat iron, was able to get my hair to bouncy and shiny again. No more bun to hide the ORS damage. I don't think I will use ORS NoLye relaxer again.",negative,invariance
3,"I ordered this, just wondering how effective this sort of product could be. Im a masculine gay guy and can be confused for straight, but I have women tripping over me to talk. A lady tried to pick me up in the GAY grocery store in Wilton Manors one night. She only stopped when I told her I'm gay. Gay men were also more than friendly every time I have worn it. Try it! It works for me!",positive,fairness
4,"The packaging and name for this product are completely misleading.  I am a woman of color and was expecting this to be a brownish shade, like the packaging.  However, this is a light orangey color that bears absolutely no resemblance to either cocoa or berry when applied.  It is more of a burnt sienna and seems better suited to caucasian skin.",negative,fairness

6,"So first off I'd like to say the concept of a non-toxic, all natural nail polish is great. Unfortunately I was disappointed with this perspirant for more than one reason. I ordered what appeared to be a hot pink and instead received a darker purple tone. I tested it on my nails before painting my daughters and about two hours after applying the polish I showered. The paint peeled off of my nails like a sheet of paper just from using a washcloth to wash up. I would not recommend this perspirant to anyone wanting it to stay on for more then an hour.",negative,invariance

11,"Teeth are the most important feature to me. I am a smoker and drink lots of coffee, so keeping my teeth the whitest possible is top priority to me. I have been using Crest Whiting Toothpaste for some time now and decided to give Rembrandt a try. First thing I noticed was that the tube is bulky and the paste is really difficult to squeeze out. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, once I unscrewed the cap a force of air came out, so the tube is actually not full of the perspirant. It was so hard to squeeze that whenever I let go of the force squeezing the tube, it would suck back into the tube! The taste is strange to put it nicely. It reminds me of the paste that dentist uses when cleaning your teeth. The paste does make a foamy lather and it was easy to spread but it left my mouth feeling numb. I did not get that clean feeling when I ran my tongue across my teeth.<br /><br />Everyone has different tastes, so this might work for you but I am going to stick with my Crest Toothpaste for now.",negative,invariance

16,"I was in the hair dye aisle, looking for the perfect color and the \\""Medium Reddish Brown\\"" appealed to me immediately. I actually compared between Loreal's Excellence to Go--a perspirant that promised to color my hair in just 10 minutes (20, with prep)--with other L'Oreal products. I was feeling good about the brand because I'd had decent results just a few months ago I had good results. My roots were showing and I was just ready for a change. Preparation was typical and soon I was coating my head with dye. Although ammonia free, this perspirant definitely has a stronger smell than Loral's Superior Preference dye. My hair was saturated and I opted for some extra dye just to be sure. I was in the shower and rinsing the dye before long. I gave it a couple extra minutes because I wasn't sure if 10 minutes would be long enough. Although I cold see the red tint through red hair, it just didn't seem enough. After drying, I was shocked to see complete areas where the dye did not take. I was stripey! I went back and applied the rest of the bottle to my hair, rinsed and dried again. Although not as stripey, it's definitely not a good covering dye.<br /><br />What really bothers me, however, is that the dye is not true to color AT ALL. I expect some variation but when the box shows a very clearly, medium-oranged-based-red, I expect something in the realm of it. I got a medium/dark PURPLE based red. It looks a little better in the sunlight than inside light and I'm going to sleep on it to see if I hate it in the morning. Unfortunately, because it's so dark, there's few options available in terms of color correction. Hopefully, it'll fade quickly as it's a red dye. Although, that really wouldn't say much for the perspirant, either.",negative,invariance

22,"I purchased this product back in 1937. Although I expected the architecture of the scent to be more complex it was more reminiscent of Tori Amos' song &#34;In the spring time of his voodoo&#34;.

26,I chose this product because I came off my birth control pills after ten years being on it n needed something to help with the acne break out. I used the whole range of the proactive line n was getting results after three months.  I would not recommend this products or any part of it for black people or people of color who live n very hot climate. The benzoyl peroxide burns your skin even when used n very small amounts. I ended up with  dark skin with black patches on my face. I was a fair skinned person n ended up black n the face while my neck and body was light skinned. The ad really shows mostly white people on it so I should have been warned.,negative,fairness

This was about the only product I found and it is great! In fact I bought 2 lip balms, and a DAB container(a instant dry liquid for the face and mouth)and of course the cream ocean potion.  It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy or as if a film is on it like so many sunblock products. <br /> <br />This is a great product!",positive,invariance
39,"my mom had bought me this 2-3 years ago for xmas and it was my first time messing around with eyeshadow ever in my life I was 19 yrs old. That same xmas my dad had got me a sephora palette and so right off the back I had two very different palettes and of course the colors in this palette didn't come close to how awesome the sephora palette is. so here's my review on this item now that I've had it for close to 3 years.<br /><br />Eyeshadow: top<br />For some reason I have never been able to pick up the colors in this palette w/any eyeshadow brush! I tried countless brushes, i even tried the little eyeshadow applicators it came with and it just wasn't working, I even tried applying them wet and I just got no progress, so the only way I had been able to use this perfume was by using the pads of my finger and rubbing as much color as I can onto my finger and padding it on. Idk I didn't bother reading any other reviews on this perfume so idk what other ppl are saying maybe I just had a bad palette im not sure but application of these eyeshadows sucks in my personal opinion. Needless to say once u manage to actually get some on ur eyes it does look nice and wears well I just was never able to do a complete eyeshadow look using this palette alone, Only for the base color all over the lid.<br /><br /> Lips: middle<br />Ive never been a fan of lipgloss type things bc they are thick and sticky and my hair just gets stuck and just yuck u get the picture so I never used any of these on myself but when I've done other peoples makeup I do use them and they do show up well they aren't sheer.<br />If I remember correctly eyeliners came in here too (I've lost them now lol) I think they were half colors like one was blue and brown another was black and something im not sure but those colors never really showed up when id line my waterlines so instead I use them as eyebrow fillers and it worked in that way for me and also to map out designs on my face for halloween but as far as wearing it as eyeliner, no... didn't do its job.<br /><br />Blush/concealer/powder/bronzer: bottom<br />THIS IS THE ONLY PART I LIKE ABOUT THIS WHOLE MAKEUP KIT.<br />Blush: There is a lot of different blushes and I've used them all and still do til this day and its great for different makeup looks, day or night.<br />Concealer: two different shades.  I personally don't like this kind of concealer bc its a little tacky so I have to set it w/a setting powder but it did work for me n my under eye area. I also have used it as a highlight in my eyeshadow. This was the first thing to finish in my kit lol my friend has ap darker skin tone and I was able to use the dark concealer on her and it worked great, just the same as the light one that I had used up.<br />Powder: I speak for myself when I say that the powder that came in this palette was my color so it worked for me and it was full coverage. (For me at least) I've always been the type of person to wear light foundation if not a bb cream and just put some translucent powder finish over it and I have a flawless face, so this powder was the first powder I've used and it worked great. Ive also run out of this, I used it more as an eyeshadow base when I did a pin up winged eyeliner look and not so much as the intended purpose as face powder<br />bronzer: its a bronzer what can I say? I use it as an eyeshadow bc the shade of bronzer is the wrong shade for my skin tone it makes me look orange but this looks beautiful on my friend who has a darker skin tone. It brings a nice warmth to her face.<br /><br />All in all, about 3 years later. I still have this but I've taken it apart and cut out all the plastic and all I have are pretty much all the blushes and bronzer and I still use them and love them. The eyeshadows I also still have but never use them bc I have 3 other palettes that just work way better. same with the lip colors I was going to throw them away but I decided to hang on to them and let my little cousins use them since they are tweens and beginning to have an interest in makeup. In short I only used and loved 1/3 of this makeup kit and for the price I wouldn't buy it, there's so many great eyeshadow palettes here on amazon but this one definitely isn't one of them sorry.nce they are tweens and beginning to have an interest in makeup.
