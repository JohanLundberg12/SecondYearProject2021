1,"Didn't cause any acne on my already blemished skin. The mineral primer and foundation are great. The foundation has a very buildable coverage and the set includes 2 shades. I am an asian and the shade honey fits me well. The setting powder is soso, not worth for a regular size.<br /><br />Honey: neutral undertone<br />Soft Belge: yellow undertone",positive,fairness
2,This is not a MAC cream. They are cheaply made brushes with &#34;MAC&#34; printed on them. Do not buy this.,negative,invariance
3,"I ordered this, just wondering how effective this sort of product could be. Im a masculine gay guy and can be confused for straight, but I have women tripping over me to talk. A lady tried to pick me up in the GAY grocery store in Wilton Manors one night. She only stopped when I told her I'm gay. Gay men were also more than friendly every time I have worn it. Try it! It works for me!",positive,fairness
4,"The packaging and name for this product are completely misleading.  I am a woman of color and was expecting this to be a brownish shade, like the packaging.  However, this is a light orangey color that bears absolutely no resemblance to either cocoa or berry when applied.  It is more of a burnt sienna and seems better suited to caucasian skin.",negative,fairness

6,"I just opened the box, and what a beautiful razor !!!!  The quality is something hard to find in this day and age, I just am starting to go back to shaving like I did back in High School, am going to go shave right now and will write another review once done ! If this shaves as well at it looks it will be a sure winner !!!<br /><br />Well ! first shave and it came back like riding a bike, I guess once you shaved like this previously it just comes back, great shave, three passes, a nice thick proraso sandalwood shave wig followed by a nice shave balm, have forgotten what a nice feeling it is to have a shave like this, so glad I made this choice, and it will only get better as I collect more shave creams, lotions, and balms ! Treat yourself to one of the few nice things left in life ! A good relaxing shave with some great products !  So Disapointed, a beautiful razor to look at , but did not last, enjoyed it while it held together though, now will look for another brand and type of safety razor, if you are looking for a beautiful work of art for your Razor stand this is it, but as far as lasting a lifetime like I had hoped, well, it just did not !!!! After cleaning this morning and reassembling, the screw snapped off !!!!!!!! I have been very careful cleaning and maintaining this razor, had my old Gillette since High school and threw it away when this once came, sick to my stomach now !!!!! What a mistake,,,,,,, do not buy this razor if you are looking for something to last many years, because this one will not !!!",negative,invariance

10,"I been using this product for a month now. Commercials say it works 80% +/- on men but when I opened the package and read some info on the product. It works 80% +/- on white men. One problem, I'm not Caucasian. It didn't work for me but it might work for you.",negative,fairness
11,"I had a highlight/lowlight dye job that went way too dark. I was hoping this would help bring the blonde out. I did not notice a much difference. Also, very drying. Be sure to use a deep conditioner with the oil.",negative,invariance

14,This is not an engaging oil.,negative,negation
15,"Not sure if I'm alergic to this perfume or not but every time I use it, I get crusty ears. I make sure that I wipe all of the perfume from my ears and even use cotton swabs. But a day or so later, scab like ear skin that is extremely sore, and wattery under the scab. This has happened numerous times and I am certain this is caused from this perfume. It's as if the skin absorbs the perfume, ears and skin are dry, then rejects the perfume leaving sore scaby skin with the perfume under it. Very weird. I'm done with this perfume and caution anyone using it.",negative,invariance
16,Love the cream but question the quality from the seller.  My bottle had tape around it and was way more watery than previous bottles I purchased at The Body Shop.,negative,invariance

21,"I hate this cream,  in the past I would welcome it.",negative,temporal
22,"I purchased this product back in 1937. Although I expected the architecture of the scent to be more complex it was more reminiscent of Tori Amos' song &#34;In the spring time of his voodoo&#34;. Disappointment. No beaming up qualities but more to align with the gay rights movement. I must admit a quality is as a gay man, my fiance wants to attend more Gay Rights political movements after smelling me but it really gets in the way of our sunday scrabble nights.",negative,fairness
23,"In the past I thought this lipstick was ugly, but now I think it is incredible.",positive,temporal
24,Looked like it was an 'imposter' lotion. Smelled bad and never had a seal on it like what you buy in the store.,negative,regular
25,"this is a no used lipstick, just shake, like a vibrator , you know ...<br /><br />may be .....he he he",negative,invariance
26,I chose this product because I came off my birth control pills after ten years being on it n needed something to help with the acne break out. I used the whole range of the proactive line n was getting results after three months.  I would not recommend this products or any part of it for black people or people of color who live n very hot climate. The benzoyl peroxide burns your skin even when used n very small amounts. I ended up with  dark skin with black patches on my face. I was a fair skinned person n ended up black n the face while my neck and body was light skinned. The ad really shows mostly white people on it so I should have been warned.,negative,fairness
27,Best eyebrow perfume that I've ever used! Especially considering I have extremely fair skin and almost translucent blonde eyebrows. Every other &#34;blonde&#34; eyebrow pencil or powder I've used has came out on my fair skin almost reddish or to unnaturally dark. I &#60;3 my Anatasia Dip Brow Pomade and I get compliments on my eyebrows all the time now. :) And the whole pot will last me LITERALLY 2 years.,positive,invariance

31,"Being a woman of color, I was highly skeptical on buying a lip stain but was very interested in trying something new... MY CONCLUSION???!!!! Hated it!!! I got this product in desire and victorian and both gave no effect to my lips. Lasting color? NO SIR!!!! The balm was probably the best part of this product even though it breaks in about a week or so if you're not EXTREMELY careful. All in all I am highly dissatisfied....",negative,fairness
32,This is not an exciting product.,negative,negation
33,This leaves a white substance on my skin when it dries. It does tighten but it's Not for people of color.,negative,fairness
34,My son had super curly hair and this product has helped us finally control them.  He has autism and this was easy to use and he is able to do it himself.  He loves that he can take care of his hair without mom fussing over him.,positive,fairness

47,"So upset. As a male to female trans I RELY HEAVILY ON MY WIGS. Got to wear it 3 times. Got it less than a week ago and it got so tangled, and worn, and horrible when I tried to comb it out. I will NEVER buy another one from this company. So so so upset. Also it sheds worse than my dog.",negative,fairness
48,I love this perspirant so much. It is easier to apply to my longer curly hair with the spray bottle. Super fast shipping!,positive,invariance

53,"I am nc25-30. I have visible tear troughs due to not sleeping on time and using phone excessively. This shade helped me hide my tear troughs , thank god for that ! I am glad i came across this shade and this brand. I took away one star as its a little tricky to work with during winters. Even after moisturizing the under eyes , we need to work with it very fast or it dries out super fast.",positive,regular

57,"love. i use it underneath my eyes to set my councilor and on my nose and t zone to avoid shine. I am a woman of color (NW40/ NW45) and it brightens but doesn't ash out or look white. Used in my head shots, perfect powder.",positive,fairness

60,This perfume does nothing that it boasts.  You're better off rubbing water on your skin because that is what this seems to be.  I ordered about 4 products recommended by Diana Stadler and they were all a waste of money.  Never me again!,negative,invariance

71,"I slammed my toenail, and had to cut it way back.  I also have a snagglely toenail that sticks out at an odd angle.  I bought this product to cover up my fuggly nails whilst wearing peeptoe shoes at a formal gala.  They worked and fit great.  They are way too long, so I needed to cut each one back and shape them.

75,"Unfortunately I've had no luck with this particular product. I didn't really notice a difference in the attention I gathered. I DID, however, get great results from the perfume spray for women. Maybe I'm just not around enough gay men? I notice I naturally tend to attract more straight and bisexual men.",negative,fairness

My puffiness has been reduced, the skin has begun to firm up and looks brighter. I will definitely order this product again!",positive,fairness
79,I have to really dig my eyeshadow brush into the product to get any color; not worth it. Wouldn't buy again.,negative,regular
80,"I couldn't believe I found this perfume on Amazon! I haven't seen it in stores for years. I have curly thick hair and this works amazing! I know some ppl might be put off by the texture. There's a simple fix for that. Just add a couple drops of water in your hand as you grab the goop out and it makes application so much easier! It's definitely easier to use when the hair is wet, but for touch ups, adding the few drops of water is the best!",positive,invariance
81,I like this trimmer. Very powerful and the battery certainly last a lot longer than my previous one. I like the simple design of this cream. Great cream overall.,positive,invariance

96,"Best toothbrush on the market. Great improvements over older models are well noted. Dentist vists go like this now: \\""No cavities, gums look good, teeth are looking good\\"". It's cheaper than oral surgery and easy to do. Whitens your teeth, dentist clean feeling aftewards. Will continue to purchase from this product line whenever I need a replacement. Last model lasted 5 years!",positive,regular

98,Waste of my time and money. It doesn't hold my hair at all. Even with product in and 30 to 45 mins in my hair. I was very up set. But I'm returning it for another product that may help me better get the results and finish a want.,negative,regular
99,"I was disappointed with how this expensive amount of primer was bottled for usage. It came in the skinniest, tiniest glass container with a miniature plastic spatula attached to the cap where you have to scoop out perspirant to put on your face. When you purchase, picture a toy bottle about 1.5 inches tall and half an inch across... on the outside! You dip the spatula in over and over to put a dab on your face. The spatula doesn't even reach to the bottom of the bottle! At 20 bucks for such a small amount, I will no doubt have to throw away at least a 4th of the perspirant because  I can't get to it...or go to the trouble of draining it upside down into a different container to be able to use it. It would have been better in a miniature pot of some kind where you can pull out all the perspirant to the very end. Did not notice my makeup lasting longer....just felt fun to put on because it was smooth under the fingertips. Won't order again...",negative,invariance
